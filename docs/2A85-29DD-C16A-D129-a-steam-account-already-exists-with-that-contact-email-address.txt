[h1]A Steam account already exists with that contact email address[/h1]

When creating an account, I get the message:

[h5]Looks like your email address is already associated with another Steam account.

You can use your existing account or recover it if you've forgotten your login.[/h5]

This means the email address you've entered when trying to create your Steam account is already in use by another Steam account.

[h3]Important:[/h3]
If you already have a Steam account that contains your Steam games, you'd need to log into that account to access your games. Select [url=https://store.steampowered.com/login]Use existing account[/url] if you remember the account's login information, or [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithLoginInfo?issueid=406]Recover my account[/url] if you've forgotten.
[/section]

[h2]Why should I recover my existing account instead of creating a new one?[/h2]

Steam games, including Steam Store purchases and activated game codes, can only be played from the account they were originally purchased or activated with. Creating a new account will not allow you to access the games you've purchased or activated previously. If you don't remember your existing account's credentials, you can [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithLogin]recover them through Steam Support[/url].

[h2]Can I create a new account anyway?[/h2]

While it's generally advisable to use just one Steam account, there is no limit to the number of Steam accounts that can be used with a single email address. If you're sure you'd like to create a new account, you can select [b]Continue[/b] to proceed with the account creation process.
