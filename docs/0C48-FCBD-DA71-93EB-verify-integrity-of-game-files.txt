[h3][b]Important:[/b] One or more files may fail to verify.[/h3]
This is normal for most Steam games. The files that fail to verify are local configuration files that should not be replaced as part of this process. [b][b]You can safely ignore this message.[/b][/b]

[h3]Warning:[/h3]
Do not run the verification process while performing other system-intensive processes, such as defragmenting your hard drive or scanning for viruses.

Do not run this process for multiple games at the same time.
