[h2]What is a StatTrak Swap Tool?[/h2]
StatTrak Swap Tools are single use items which allow players to transfer kill counts from one StatTrak weapon to another so long as the weapon is the same.

Kills from a StatTrak M4A1-S can only be transferred to another StatTrak M4A1-S using a Swap Tool, [i]not[/i] to another weapon.

StatTrak Swap Tools can be purchased for $.99 USD in-game or from the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/market/]Community Market[/url].
