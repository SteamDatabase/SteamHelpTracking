[h2]Factory Reset[/h2]

For situations where you want to clear all local data (including games, etc.) and reinstall Steam / SteamOS, you can make use of this feature.

This option can be used if your device can boot successfully into Steam.

[olist]

[*]While in Steam, press the "Steam" button, go to "Settings" and then "System".

[*]From there scroll down to the Factory Reset option and select the "Factory Reset" button.

Note: The 'Re-install SteamOS' option may require an active internet connection. If a system file has been modified, this operation will download the original version to restore them to an unmodified state. If you cannot or do not want to connect the device to the internet, you can disable the 'Re-install SteamOS' option or use the [url=#menu]"Rollback to previous OS"[/url] option to revert to the previous version of SteamOS.

[h2]Rollback to previous OS[/h2]

SteamOS has the ability to recover to a last known good version of the Operating System (OS) while retaining user data (e.g. installed games, saves, etc.). This can be useful for situations where you believe some recent modification in the OS may have caused an issue, or you suspect you have corrupted data in your current OS and want to retain your user data.

To roll back to the previous OS, see the instructions below:

[olist]

[*]Fully power the unit down by holding the power button for 10 seconds. We recommend to do these steps while the unit is plugged into the power supply.

[*]Hold the "..." button down and press the power button to turn on the device

[*]Continue to hold the "..." button down until you see a menu labeled "SteamOS"

The recovery menu will look something like below:

[*]From this menu you would choose the second option from the top that says "Previous SteamOS..."

[h2]Erase user data from device[/h2]

This option is useful if you want to erase all local user data on your Steam Deck or other SteamOS device but do not want to, or cannot load into game mode to use the Factory Reset option to erase it. Accessing this menu requires specific button presses and for the device to be completely shut down.

[h2]Install / Re-image / Repair SteamOS [/h2]

If you would like to install SteamOS on your device, have installed another OS and would like to get back to SteamOS, or are experiencing other breaking issues, you can re-image SteamOS onto your device.

Currently, the only devices officially 'Powered by SteamOS' are Steam Deck and Legion Go S. We are working on broadening support, and with the recent updates to Steam and SteamOS 3.7, compatibility with other AMD powered PC handhelds has been improved.
