[h2]Do products I purchase on my Steam account have any region restrictions?[/h2]
In most cases, there are no region restrictions on products purchased directly from the Steam store. However, products purchased as gifts may have region restrictions. Please see the [url=#gifts]gifts section[/url] for more information.

[h2]How will I know if a product has region restrictions?[/h2]

Most products purchased for yourself on Steam do not have region restrictions.  Any region restriction on a product will be clearly noted on the product's Steam Store page as shown below:

[h2]What if I am traveling and the product I am trying to purchase has a note about region restrictions?[/h2]

[h1][b]CD Keys[/b][/h1]
[hr][/hr]

[h2]I purchased a CD key from another retailer. Is it restricted to a certain region?[/h2]

Region restrictions on CD Keys vary by each individual publisher. There is no standard or universal restriction placed on retail games.

[h2]How do I know when a CD Key or retail product is region restricted?[/h2]

Region restrictions on CD Keys should be noted by the publisher on the retail packaging of the product. To be safe, ask the retailer if there are any region restrictions on this product before purchasing. If you have issues with the purchased product, please contact the retail store where it was purchased.

[h2]I’m getting an error "[i]Game not available in your territory[/i]" when I’m trying to add a CD Key to my account. What should I do?[/h2]

You will see this error message if you have purchased a regionally restricted copy of a game and you try to register its CD Key in a different region. If you do not live in the designated region for that game you must contact the seller for a refund. Steam Support cannot offer refunds on CD Keys purchased from 3rd party retailers.

[h2]Can I use a proxy, VPN or disguise my location to redeem a region restricted Steam Gift?[/h2]
