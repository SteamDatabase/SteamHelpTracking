[h2]Begin the installation process to cause Steam to recognize existing files[/h2]
Games may appear uninstalled when Steam no longer recognizes the installation files. As long as the affected game's folder is still in the proper location, attempting to launch the game will prompt a download. This will allow Steam to recognize the installation files during the download process.

You can ensure that the game folders are in the proper location by navigating to your default Steam installation:

[code]C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common[/code]

[h2]Add previously existing alternate installation libraries/folders to Steam[/h2]
If you had previously installed the games to an alternate location outside of your main Steam folder here's how you can add them to your Steam Library:

[olist]

[*]Launch Steam and go to Steam > Settings > Downloads and click the Steam Library Folders button. This will open the Storage Manager.  [/*]
[*]Here you can see manage your game installations and locations. Near the top of the Storage Manager, click the "+" button to add another folder of your installed games. [/*]

[/olist]

Once you have added the new Library folder your installed games should appear in your Steam Library.

[h2]Reinstalling games[/h2]
If Steam does not recognize your games after completing the instructions that are listed above, it is recommended that you completely reinstall the games in question.

[h2]External Hard Drives[/h2]
External hard drives are not recommended for use with Steam or Steam's games. Aside from many potential performance issues, external hard drives may connect or disconnect from the computer at inopportune times as part of their normal operations. If you encounter this issue with an external drive, install Steam and your games to an internal drive instead.

To ensure that you do not encounter this issue, always allow Steam to close properly when shutting down your computer. Allowing Windows to force Steam to close when it is writing to a hard drive may cause Steam library and installation information to become corrupted.

Additionally, third party applications can prevent Steam from writing essential information. Ensure that none of your installed applications are interfering with Steam:
