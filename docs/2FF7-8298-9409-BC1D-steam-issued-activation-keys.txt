[h1]Steam-Issued Activation Keys[/h1]

Some Steam games may provide you with an additional activation key once they have been downloaded on a Steam account. These keys appear in the Steam library when you right-click the game and select 'Manage' -> 'CD keys'. These keys are used to register your product outside of Steam, with a third party client or service.

[h4]Why am I not receiving my Steam-issued third party key?[/h4]
Make sure that the game has been successfully downloaded and installed through the Steam client. A key will not be issued on the Steam account until the download has begun.

If the key is still not generating, please [url=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2037-QEUH-3335]verify integrity of game files[/url] and restart the Steam client.

[h5]Contacting third-party support[/h5]

Steam does not have access to third-party registration systems and cannot resolve issues with registration.

You can find the third-party game's support contact information by selecting the game in your Steam Library and then on the right hand side select "Support" from the tabs available above the "Activity" section.

Make sure to provide them with your Steam-issued CD Key so that they can better assist you.
