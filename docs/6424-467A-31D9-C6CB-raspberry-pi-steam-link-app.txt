[expand type=title title="Frequently Asked Questions"]

[h4]The game is choppy and unresponsive. How can I improve the experience?[/h4]
Using a wired network is strongly recommended with the Raspberry Pi.

You can also try switching to the ‘Fast’ streaming quality option from the Streaming settings in the Steam Link. You can find out more information about improving wireless experience [url=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=4950-EBNM-7843]here[/url].

[h4]Can I use the Steam Controller in Bluetooth mode?[/h4]
Bluetooth mode is not supported on the Raspberry Pi. The wireless dongle that came with your Steam Controller is lower latency and works well. Your Steam Controller can be paired with the dongle in the controller settings in the Steam Link app.

[h4]Can I use an input device not listed on this page?[/h4]
Steam Support is unable to provide assistance with unsupported devices, however, we do have an active community that may have found solutions to the issue you’ve encountered.

Please visit the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/353380/discussions/6/]Steam Link section of the Steam Discussion forums.[/url]

[h4]Can I use surround sound?[/h4]
Surround sound works using HDMI multi-channel PCM. If your sound system only supports encoded surround sound (AC3, Dolby DTS, etc.) you should use Stereo audio streaming settings.

[h4]Experiencing Performance Issues?[/h4]
If you are experiencing performance issues please ensure that your [url=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=4950-EBNM-7843]settings are optimized for Streaming.[/url]

[h4]Xbox triggers reversed?[/h4]
If the Xbox controller triggers are reversed, you are probably using the unsupported xboxdrv gamepad driver. You can go to the Steam Link app controller settings and remap your controller to work with this driver.
