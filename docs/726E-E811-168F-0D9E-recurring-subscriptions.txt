[h4]Will reactivating my Subscription give me access to my old game history?[/h4]
This depends on the game. In some cases, your game data will automatically be re-linked to your Steam account. If this has not happened, you will need to contact the publisher of the game and have them re-initiate your previous game account and link it to your Steam account. Support contact information for a game can be found using the steps below:
