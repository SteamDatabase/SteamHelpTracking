[h2]Notes about these lists[/h2]

Revenue specifics are not disclosed for the games on each list, so we group them together into buckets. The games within each bucket are randomly sorted:

[list]

[*] Platinum: 1st - 12th

[*] Gold: 13th - 24th

[*] Silver: 25th - 50th

[*] Bronze: 51st - 100th

[/list]

These lists are initially generated at the end of December with data for most of the year. Some lists will get updated in January with final data. See notes at the top of each chart for any relevant details about incomplete data.

[h2]New Releases[/h2]

These are the best-selling releases of the year. This list is created by looking at every game and DLC released between January 1 and December 31, then selecting the top ones based on their first two weeks of gross revenue after releasing.

This list is initially generated on December 15th to include all games released through the end of November. The list and data is updated again on January 15th to include any games released in December.
