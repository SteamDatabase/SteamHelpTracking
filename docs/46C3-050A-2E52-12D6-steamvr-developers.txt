[section id=compat]

[h4]How do I get my game to show up as Rift or Vive compatible in the Steam store?[/h4]
To configure an app with VR support, go to your app landing page and select [b]Edit Steamworks Settings[/b] then navigate to the [b]Installation tab[/b] and then select [b]General Installation[/b].

You will need to change your [b]Launch Options[/b] to one of the three types below:

[list]

[*][b]Launch SteamVR App[/b] - Use this for VR apps that use SteamVR. [/*]
[*][b]Launch SteamVR Overlay[/b] - Use this for apps that supply a SteamVR dashboard overlay. [/*]
[*][b]Launch in Other VR[/b] - Use this for apps that provide a VR mode other than SteamVR, for example those implemented using the Oculus SDK. [/*]

[/list]

Picking one of these three options will either present the launch option to the user or it will be applied automatically at the appropriate times when the user launches the app from their Library.
