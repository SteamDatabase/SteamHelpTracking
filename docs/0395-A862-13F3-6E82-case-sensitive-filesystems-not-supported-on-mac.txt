[h1]Case Sensitive Filesystems not supported on Mac[/h1]

Steam gives me the error, "Steam requires that ~/Library/Application Support/Steam be created on a case insensitive filesystem." or "Steam requires that ~/Documents/Steam Content be created on a case insensitive filesystem."

Steam does not currently support case sensitive filesystems or partitions.

If you wish to use Steam please make sure of the following:

[list]

[*]Steam is installed on a case-insensitive partition or hard drive
[*]Your User folder is installed on a case-insensitive partition or hard drive
[/list]

To check whether you have a case-sensitive partition:

[list]

[*]Open the program Terminal
[*]Type in: diskutil info /
[*]Hit enter
[*]Scroll down until you see the line "File System Personality."
[/list]

If it shows "Case-sensitive Journaled HFS", "APFS (Case-sensitive)" or "APFS (Case-sensitive, Encrypted)" the hard drive IS case-sensitive.

If it shows "Journaled HFS", "APFS", "APFS (Encrypted)" the hard drive is NOT case-sensitive.

For advanced users familiar with Unix and Terminal, you may be able to get your case-sensitive system to work by using symbolic links.

Otherwise, you will need to install Steam to a different partition on this computer, or a different harddrive completely.
