[h2]DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS[/h2]

[list]

[*]The hues, greyscale values, and line widths of the cursors need to read well in all map locations and lighting situations. [/*]
[*]The edges of the images should be as clean as possible.  [/*]
[*]Don't force a lot of details into the cursor images if it makes them too busy or hard to read. Keep the design simple and stylized to display as clearly as possible. [/*]
