[*][b]Craft a game badge[/b]
Starting one week prior to the start of the sale, crafting a game badge earns you a mystery card. During the sale, each game badge you craft will get you an additional Steam Sale Trading Card.

[*][b]Make a purchase[/b]
As an extra reward for purchasing, for every $10 USD spent during the sale you’ll receive a Steam Sale Trading Card. From your sale badge page select “How do I get more cards?” to track your purchasing progress.

[*][b]Trade for them[/b]
That’s why they’re called trading cards! Find friends with other cards and make trades. Your Steam Sale badge page shows which friends have the cards you need.

[*][b]Buy them from the Community Market[/b]
Sell the cards you don’t need and buy the ones you do, all with other Community members on the Community Marketplace. Turn those duplicate cards into Steam Wallet funds to buy games.
