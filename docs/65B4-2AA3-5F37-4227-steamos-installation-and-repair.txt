Currently, the only devices officially 'Powered by SteamOS' are [b]Steam Deck[/b] and [b]Legion Go S.[/b] We are working on broadening support, and with the recent updates to Steam and SteamOS 3.7, compatibility with other AMD powered PC handhelds has been improved.

[h2]Installing SteamOS [/h2]

[olist]

[*] [b]Download the SteamOS image [url=https://store.steampowered.com/steamos/download/?ver=steamdeck]here (click)[/url].[/b]

[*] Prepare a USB key (8GB minimum) with the recovery image:

[list]

[*] On [b]Windows [/b]we recommend using the [url=https://rufus.ie/en/]Rufus utility[/url]. Select the recovery file and write it to your USB drive (this will format your USB drive). When it's done, select 'Close' and eject the drive.

[*] On [b]MacOS [/b]you can use [url=https://www.balena.io/etcher/]Balena Etcher[/url] to write the recovery file to your USB drive.

[*] On [b]Linux [/b]you can also use [url=https://www.balena.io/etcher/]Balena Etcher[/url] to write the recovery file to your USB drive - or if you prefer you can do this directly from the command line:
[code]bzcat steamdeck-recovery-4.img.bz2 | sudo dd if=/dev/stdin of=/dev/sdX oflag=sync status=progress bs=128M[/code] (set /dev/sdX to the USB device you inserted)
[/list]

[*] Shut down your Steam Deck or other device if it isn't already off. On a Steam Deck, hold 'Volume Up' and click the Power Button - when you hear the chime, let go of the Volume Up button, and you'll be booted into the Boot Menu. Use the dpad and A button to select the Boot Manager.

[list]

[*] On most non-Steam Deck devices, you will need to disable Secure Boot in order to boot from a USB drive. [url=#secureboot]Learn more here [/url]

[*] Follow the instructions for your specific device to get to the Boot Menu.

[/list]

[*] Use a USB-C adapter or hub to plug the boot disk in.

[*] In the Boot Manager, boot from the 'EFI USB Device' (your USB key)

[*] The screen will go dark while it's booting - give it a minute.

[*] Once booted you will be in a desktop environment, you can navigate using trackpad and trigger, touchscreen, or mouse.

[*] Select the [b]Re-image Device[/b] option on the desktop. This will fully wipe your device and install stock SteamOS.

[*] Once it's done installing, reboot and you will be in the SteamOS welcome experience.
