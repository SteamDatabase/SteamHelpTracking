Big Picture is a mode of Steam designed for use with your TV and game controller, so you can enjoy your Steam games from the comfort of your couch. With the press of a button, Steam displays a full-screen user interface which has been completely redesigned for readability and interaction on TV. It can also be used on your usual computer display.

To determine whether a game is controller-enabled, please refer to the following tags:

[h4]Full Support  [img]https://store.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/public/images/v6/ico/ico_controller.png[/img][/h4]
Titles marked with "Full Controller Support" indicate that they can be downloaded, launched and played using only a controller.  These titles do not require a mouse or keyboard on hand for any configuration or in-game setup.

[h4]Partial Support  [img]https://store.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/public/images/v6/ico/ico_partial_controller.png[/img][/h4]
Titles marked with "Partial Controller Support" indicate that mouse and keyboard may be required from time to time.  A controller may be used while in game, however installation,  configuration and overall user interface may only be optimized for mouse and keyboard.
