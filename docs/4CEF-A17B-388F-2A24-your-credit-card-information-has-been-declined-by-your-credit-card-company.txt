[h3]Why has my credit card information been declined?[/h3]
There are several reasons that a card my be declined.

[list]

[*]Your bank may limit the number of transactions or total amount that can be spent online in a certain period of time. [/*]
[*]You may have entered the incorrect CVV2 code [/*]
[*]You may have entered your credit card information incorrectly [/*]
[*]Your bank account may be flagged by your bank due to suspicious purchasing activity [/*]
[*]Your stored credit card may have expired [/*]
[*]Your bank may have rendered your card invalid due to fraudulent looking purchases elsewhere [/*]

[/list]

Double check the information that you are entering with this credit card and contact your bank if the issue persists.

[h3]The CVV2 code[/h3]
The CVV2 code is the 3-digit code that appears on the back of your card, within or near the signature box.

Many banks will accept charges for online purchases that contain an incorrect CVV2 code.

Steam will never accept payment from a transaction that fails this check. If your bank has set funds aside for this transaction, they will be returned to your account per your bank's policy. For some banks, this may take up to 10 business days.

[h3]I have entered my billing information correctly, but still see this error[/h3]
Ensure that you first double-check this information against what your bank has on record.

In some very rare cases, there may be an issue with the information that your bank checks this information against, or the verification system may be temporarily malfunctioning. If you suspect that this is the case, you may wish to purchase a [url=https://store.steampowered.com/account/redeemwalletcode]Steam Wallet card[/url] from a physical retailer or use an alternate payment method.
