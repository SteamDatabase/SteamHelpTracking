[*]Your index finger rests comfortably on the trigger. [/*]
[*]The pad of your thumb rests naturally on the Track Button’s surface without obscuring the LED above or the System Button below. [/*]
[*]The hand strap rests behind your knuckles on the back of your hand. [/*]
[*]For added security, tighten the Index Controllers to your wrists using the provided lanyards. [/*]
