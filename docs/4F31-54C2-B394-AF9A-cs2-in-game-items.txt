[section id=whataresm]

[h2]What are Service Medals and what happens when I accept one?[/h2]
Service Medals are in-game display items available to players once their Counter-Strike profile rank has reached rank 40. Once you have reached rank 40, a 'Get Service Medal' button will appear above your profile rank progress bar. Selecting this option will reset your profile to rank 1 and will add a Service Medal to your Inventory. Your Competitive Skill Group will be unaffected.

Different Service Medals are available every year beginning January 1st at 12:00 AM PST, each with unique appearances.
[/section]

[section id=vetcoins]

[h2]What are 5 and 10 Year Veteran Coins and how do I earn them?[/h2]
5 and 10 Year Counter-Strike 2 Veteran Coins are granted automatically to accounts which have logged into and played Counter-Strike 2 in the 5 or 10 years prior to the coin eligibility date and are in good VAC standing, meaning the account has not been VAC, Overwatch, or Game banned. Accounts that have been VAC banned in [i]any[/i] game on Steam or are trade banned are not eligible to receive Counter-Strike 2 Veteran Coins.

Your account's Veteran Coin eligibility can be verified on your Counter-Strike 2 personal game data page by following the instructions below:

[list]

[*]Log into Steam on the web and browse to your Profile page.

[*]On the right select 'Games', then find 'Counter-Strike: Global Offensive' > 'My Game Stats' > 'Personal Game Data'.

[*]On the 'Account Information' tab scroll down and look for 'First Counter-Strike franchise game'. Five and ten years from the date shown here is when your account is eligible to receive the associated Veteran Coin(s).
[/list]
When you qualify for the coins you will need to launch Counter-Strike 2 to receive them. Veteran Coins are not granted until the game has been launched.

[b]Note:[/b] If you have refunded or removed a Counter-Strike license from your account the original registration date will no longer be recognized. The date shown on the Account Information tab is the date Veteran Coins recognize.
[/section]

[section id=whatarelb]

[h2]What are Loyalty Badges and how do I earn one?[/h2]
Loyalty Badges were issued to Steam accounts when CS:GO went free to play on December 6th, 2018.

To be eligible for the Loyalty Badge, your Steam account had to be in good VAC standing (meaning no bans in CS:GO) and must have owned and launched CS:GO in the five years prior to December 6th, 2018. If you did not receive the Loyalty Badge it is because you did not meet one of the requirements.

Loyalty Badges cannot be manually granted and it is no longer possible to receive one.
[/section]

[section id=whatareoc]

[h2]What are Operation and Major Tournament Coins?[/h2]
Operation and Major Tournament Coins are upgradeable display items given to players who complete missions during their respective events. The more missions a player completes during the event the more their display item may be upgraded.

Once the event has concluded the display item can no longer be upgraded.
[/section]

[section id=removemedal]

[h2]Can I modify or remove Service Medals, Coins, or other display items on my account?[/h2]
No. Service Medals, Coins of any kind, badges, pins, and other display items cannot be modified or removed from an account once they have been added.
[/section]

[section id=whatarestick]

[h2]What are Stickers?[/h2]
Stickers in Counter-Strike 2 are single use in-game items that can be placed on players' weapons in almost any location. Stickers can be moved around and rotated prior to being applied and a maximum of five stickers can be applied to any weapon.

Once applied, stickers can be scraped to begin the removal process or to change their appearance. To do this, left-click on a weapon in your Counter-Strike 2 Inventory which has Stickers, select 'Scrape Sticker', and click on the Sticker you'd like to scrape.

Stickers can be purchased through in-game offers or from the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/market/]Community Market[/url].

[b]Note:[/b] Scraping a Sticker cannot be undone. Once you have clicked on a Sticker to scrape it the results are permanent.
[/section]

[section id=movesticker]

[h2]I have applied a Sticker and would like to move it. Can I do this?[/h2]
No. Once a Sticker has been placed on a weapon it cannot be moved. If you would like to remove the Sticker you will need to scrape it in-game until the 'Remove Sticker' option appears.

[b]Note:[/b] Removing a Sticker from a weapon is permanent and the Sticker will not be returned to your Inventory.
[/section]

[section id=stickergone]

[h2]Stickers on my weapon are not visible when I inspect in-game. Why is this?[/h2]
Stickers on your weapon may not be visible because they have been heavily scraped. The more a sticker is scraped the less vibrant it is, and stickers that have been heavily scraped may only leave a faint outline of the original sticker. This is by design and cannot be modified.

You are free to completely remove the sticker by scraping it further using the in-game UI.
[/section]

[section id=whatissu]

[h2]What are Storage Units?[/h2]
Storage Units are in-game items used to expand and better organize your Counter-Strike 2 Inventory. A Storage Unit adds an additional 1,000 item capacity to your Counter-Strike 2 Inventory.
[/section]

[section id=howdoisu]

[h2]How do I get a Storage Unit?[/h2]
Storage Units can be purchased in-game for $1.99.
[/section]

[section id=whoneedssu]

[h2]Who needs a Storage Unit?[/h2]
Any user who wants to hold more than 1,000 items in their Counter-Strike 2 Inventory will need a Storage Unit. Even if you have not reached the 1,000 item Inventory limit, Storage Units can be labeled and used as a way to more effectively organize your Counter-Strike 2 Inventory.
[/section]

[section id=depositsu]

[h2]How do I deposit items to a Storage Unit?[/h2]
There are two ways to deposit items into a Storage Unit:

[list]

[*]Click on an item in your Inventory, select 'Move to Storage Unit', and select the Storage Unit you would like to move the item to. [/*]
[*]Click on the Storage Unit in your Inventory and select 'Deposit Items', then select which items you would like to add to the Storage Unit. [/*]

[section id=retrievesu]

[h2]How do I retrieve items from a Storage Unit?[/h2]
There are two ways to retrieve items from a Storage Unit:

[list]

[*]Click on a Storage Unit in your Inventory and select 'Inspect', then select the item(s) you would like to retrieve and click RETRIEVE at the bottom of the screen. [/*]

[/list]

[/section]

[section id=whereretrieve]

[h2]I retrieved an item but can not find it in my Inventory. Where did it go?[/h2]
When items are retrieved from a Storage Unit they are added back to your Counter-Strike 2 Inventory in the same location they were prior to being deposited. Retrieved items will not appear at the top of your Counter-Strike 2 Inventory.

If you can not find the retrieved item we suggest scrolling through your Inventory or searching for the item using 'Search Items'. It is not possible to lose items you are depositing or retrieving from Storage Units because they never leave your account.
[/section]

[section id=interactsu]

[h2]How can I interact with items placed in a Storage Unit?[/h2]
Any item in a Storage Unit cannot be equipped, consumed, traded, marketed, renamed, or altered until it is retrieved to your Inventory.
[/section]

[section id=tradesu]

[h2]Can I trade or market items in a Storage Unit?[/h2]
No, you would need to take the items out of the Storage Unit first. Storage Units are singular in purpose and only meant for holding items. If your Storage Unit is empty it can be deleted in-game.
[/section]

[section id=renamesu]

[h2]How often can I rename a Storage Unit?[/h2]
Storage Units can be renamed as often as you would like. To rename a Storage Unit click on it in your Inventory and select 'Change Label'.
[/section]

[section id=whataretuc]

[h2]What are Trade Up Contracts?[/h2]
Trade Up Contracts allow players to trade 10 normal or StatTrak weapon skins of the same rarity for one weapon skin of the next highest rarity from one of the weapon collections used in the Trade Up Contract. The rarity of the item received from the Trade Up Contract will always be one higher tier than the items with which it is crafted. Ten Mil-spec (blue) skins will always trade up to a Restricted (purple) tier skin and so on.

To use a Trade Up Contract, left-click on an eligible weapon and select 'Use With Trade Up Contract'.
[/section]

[section id=whatitemstuc]

[h2]Which weapons can be used in Trade Up Contracts?[/h2]
A Trade Up Contract requires all ten weapons to be the same weapon rarity (Mil-Spec, Restricted, Classified, etc.) and [i]either[/i] normal or StatTrak. Normal weapon skins cannot be used in a Trade Up Contract with StatTrak weapon skins and vice versa.

To verify if a weapon can be used in a Trade Up Contract, hover over the weapon in your Counter-Strike 2 Inventory and look for the Collection it is included in. Covert (red) rarity weapons and weapons which are already the rarest in their collection (like the R8 Revolver | Amber Fade) cannot be used in any Trade Up Contract.
[/section]

[section id=whatarent]

Name Tags can be purchased for $1.99 USD in-game or from the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/market/]Steam Community Market[/url].
[/section]
