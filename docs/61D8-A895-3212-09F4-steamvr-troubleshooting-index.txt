[h4]SteamVR fails to start, quits unexpectedly or is unresponsive[/h4]
Start by performing all the steps from the General Troubleshooting section above. If your problem persists, you can try running SteamVR in safe mode:

[*]Type "run" into the Windows search bar. [/*]
[*]Type "vrmonitor://safemode/enable" into the Run window. [/*]
[*]You can exit safe mode at any time from the dialog above the SteamVR status window. [/*]

If safe mode has not resolved your issue, click "Contact Steam Support" below to get help.

[h4]SteamVR Safe Mode[/h4]
SteamVR's safe mode prevents the loading of some third party drivers and other components that can cause problems. If safe mode resolves your issue, it is likely that you have installed something that is interfering with SteamVR. For example, some VR "utility" applications such as Natural Locomotion and LIV are known to conflict with SteamVR in some cases.
