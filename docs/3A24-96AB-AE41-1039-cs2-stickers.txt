[h2]What are Stickers?[/h2]
Stickers in Counter-Strike 2 are single use in-game items that can be placed on players' weapons in almost any location. Stickers can be moved around and rotated prior to being applied and a maximum of five stickers can be applied to any weapon.

Once applied, stickers can be scraped to begin the removal process or to change their appearance. To do this, left-click on a weapon in your Counter-Strike 2 Inventory which has Stickers, select 'Scrape Sticker', and drag the scrape slider to achieve your desired look.

[b]Note:[/b] Scraping a Sticker cannot be undone. Once you have scraped a Sticker the results are permanent.

[h2]I have applied a Sticker and would like to move it. Can I do this?[/h2]
No. Once a Sticker has been placed on a weapon it cannot be moved. If you would like to remove the Sticker you will need to select the 'Remove Sticker' option.

[b]Note:[/b] Removing a Sticker from a weapon is permanent and the Sticker will not be returned to your Inventory.

[h2]Stickers on my weapon are not visible when I inspect in-game. Why is this?[/h2]
Stickers on your weapon may not be visible because they have been heavily scraped. The more a sticker is scraped the less vibrant it is, and stickers that have been heavily scraped may only leave a faint outline of the original sticker. This is by design and cannot be modified.

You are free to completely remove the sticker by selecting the 'Remove Sticker' option.
