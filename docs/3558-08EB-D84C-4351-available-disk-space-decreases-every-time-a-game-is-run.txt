[h1]Available disk space decreases every time a game is run[/h1]

The amount of available disk space on my machine decreases every time I run a game - what should I do?

[section style=important]

[h3]Important:[/h3]
Disabling System Restore for any drive which you do not back up regularly is [b]not[/b] recommended.
[/section]

There are several causes for this condition which this article will not cover:

[list]

[*]Game patches and updates are being downloaded automatically through Steam [/*]
[*]Files for saved games are being created (for single-player games) [/*]
[*]Custom content downloads are occurring (for multiplayer games) [/*]

[/list]

If you notice that [b]50 - 100 MB[/b] of available hard disk space is being used every time you start a game, you may need to disable System Restore for the drive which is storing your game files.
