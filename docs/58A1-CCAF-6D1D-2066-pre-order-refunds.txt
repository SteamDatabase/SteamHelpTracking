[h1]Pre-Order Refunds[/h1]

[h4]Can I refund my pre-order?[/h4]
You may refund your pre-order any time prior to the release of the game.

If the pre-order title was purchased more than 3 months ago, you may not be able to refund back to your original payment method. However, you may still request a credit to your Steam Wallet.

[h4]Can I still refund my pre-order after the game comes out?[/h4]
Preordered games that have been released are still eligible for a refund, as long as the refund request is submitted within two weeks of the game’s release, and the game has been played for less than two hours.

[h4]I gifted a pre-order to my friend. Is this gift eligible for a refund?[/h4]
Even if the gift has been redeemed, you may still request a refund for this pre-order. To request a refund on a Steam gift, we will need the gift recipient to first initiate the refund and approve the removal of this purchase from their account.

The same guidelines apply: a refund may be issued for any pre-ordered gift prior to the game’s release or within fourteen days of the game’s release and with under two hours of playtime by the gift recipient.

If your preorder came with an extra giftable copy of the game, you will need to have the account that redeemed the extra copy approve the refund as well. Please refer to the section "Can I refund my gift?" in our [url=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=6262-QXCN-0755#giftrefund]Steam Gifts[/url] article for further information.

If the gift or the extra copy has not been redeemed, you may request a refund for your preordered title at any time.
