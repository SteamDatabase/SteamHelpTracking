[h1]Family Library Sharing[/h1]

Family Sharing allows family members to share games while keeping their accounts separate.

Family and guests can play one another's games while earning their own Steam achievements and saving their own game progress to the Steam Cloud. It works by granting family members access to games on a shared computer.

[h4]Managing which devices and accounts have access to Family Library Sharing[/h4]
You can log into the Steam client and open Settings > "Family" tab and in the  Family Library Sharing section click "Manage". Here you can deauthorize any computer or account that's been authorized to share your library.

Or, you can [url=https://store.steampowered.com/account/managedevices]remotely deauthorize computers from the web[/url]. Visit your Account Details page, and then select "Manage Family Library Sharing". Using either the client or the web site, you can [url=https://store.steampowered.com/account/managedevices]view all currently authorized devices[/url] and accounts and use the revoke link to deauthorize any or all of them.

[h4]Disabling Family Sharing[/h4]
In these same settings, deselect any account from the list of authorized users to prohibit them from accessing your games.

[url id=dontlivewithme][/url]

[h5]Can I share my games with users that don't live with me?[/h5]
While Family Sharing can work for users that are not accessing Steam from the same location, due to technical limitations, the feature may encounter issues that Steam is unable to provide support for.

[url id=inuse][/url]

[h5]I want to play my own games, but they're being played by another account. What do I do?[/h5]
As the owner, you may always access and play your games at any time. If you decide to start playing when another user is already playing one of your games, he/she will see a message giving them five minutes to either purchase or quit out of the game.

[url id=gamevslibrary][/url]

[h5]Can I share specific games?[/h5]
No, libraries are shared in their entirety. You aren't able to select specific games to share or exclude.

Additionally, for users that are borrowing multiple Steam Libraries, they will be unable to choose who they borrow a game from.

[url id=excludedgames][/url]

[h5]Can all Steam games be shared?[/h5]
No, due to technical limitations, some Steam games and content may be unavailable for sharing. Games or content that matches the criteria below cannot be shared between accounts.

[list]

[*]Games that require an additional third-party key, account, or a subscription in order to play

[*]Free to play games and any purchased DLC for those games

[*]Free DLC for a game

[*]Games or DLC that is restricted in your or the borrower's region

[*]Games the owner has a VAC or Game Ban in

[*]Base games that the borrower already owns

[*]Games that do not support the borrower's operating system

[*]Games the owner has (automatically) from belonging to a Steamworks partner account

[/list]

[url id=simultaneous][/url]

[h5]Can two users share a library and both play at the same time?[/h5]
No, a shared library may only be played by one user at a time including the owner and even if they want to play different games.

[url id=sharelimit][/url]

[h5]Is there a limit to the number of accounts I can share my Library with?[/h5]
Yes. A Steam account may authorize Family Library Sharing on up to 5 accounts and on up to 10 devices in a 90 day period. This includes accounts/devices that you have cancelled sharing with in that same time period.

[url id=dlc][/url]

[h5]DLC and in-game content[/h5]
A borrower will have access to the lender's games and DLC, but only if the borrower [b]does not[/b] also own the base game. If they already own the game, they'll need to purchase the DLC themselves in order to play it. For free to play games, DLC cannot be shared since all Steam users "own" the game.

Any user may purchase, trade, earn, or otherwise acquire in-game content while playing a game, but in-game items cannot be shared between accounts. These items remain the property of the account that purchased or acquired them.

Trading cards will not be dropped while playing a shared game.

[url id=regionrestriction][/url]

[h5]Can region-restricted games be shared across regions?[/h5]
No, any region restrictions will remain in place when lending or borrowing games.

[url id=VACban][/url]

[h5]What if a borrower is caught cheating or committing fraud while playing my shared games?[/h5]
Your Family Sharing privileges may be revoked and your account may also be VAC banned if a borrower cheats or commits fraud. In addition, not all VAC protected games are shareable. We recommend you only authorize familiar Steam Accounts and familiar computers you know to be secure. And as always, never give your password to anyone.

[section style=important]If you receive a VAC ban, you will be unable to share [url=http://store.steampowered.com/search/?category2=8]any VAC protected games[/url].

[h4]Troubleshooting Family Sharing[/h4]
If you are experiencing issues with an entire shared library, it's likely that there is an authorization issue with device or user that was previously authorized.

If you are experiencing an issue with a specific game or DLC in a shared library, it's likely that the game is not available for sharing for one of the reasons outlined in the FAQ above.

[h5]Re-authorizing a shared library[/h5]
This is always a good first step to ensure that Family Sharing is working correctly.

[olist]

[*]The owner of the shared library needs to access their [url=https://store.steampowered.com/account/managedevices]Device Management[/url] page. From there, deauthorize the device that is giving you issues by selecting the [i]Revoke[/i] link across from its name. [/*]
[*]Now, the borrower should attempt to launch one of the games in the shared library which will open request to share. [/*]
[*]Requesting access will send the game owner an authorization email. [/*]
[*]They need to click on the link in the email to authorize that computer and grant access to the library. [/*]

[/olist]

[h5]Shared library locked[/h5]
This is error indicates that someone else is using the shared library. A Steam library can only be used by one user at a time to play one game at a time. The same is true if that library is being accessed by another user via Family Sharing.

[h5]Rate limit exceeded[/h5]
A Steam account may authorize Family Library Sharing on up to 5 accounts and on up to 10 devices in a 90 day period. This includes accounts/devices that were previously shared to and have since been cancelled. In order to add a new authorization to Family Sharing after having reached the limit, users will have to cancel an existing link and then wait out the 90 day cooldown period.

You will need to wait for the cooldown to expire before authorizing another machine. Steam Support does not remove these cooldowns.
