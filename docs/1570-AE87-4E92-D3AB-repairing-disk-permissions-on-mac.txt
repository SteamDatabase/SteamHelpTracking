[h1]Repairing Disk Permissions on Mac[/h1]

I'm having trouble running Steam or playing my games, what can I do to fix it?

Often, disk permissions become inconsistent over time. Some of these problems have a negative impact on Steam. If Steam does not start, or games do not launch, please try this first:

[*]Click on [b]Applications > Utilities > Disk Utility[/b] [/*]
[*]Click on the [b]First Aid[/b] tab [/*]
[*]Let the repair process finish and then restart Steam to see if this corrects the problem [/*]
