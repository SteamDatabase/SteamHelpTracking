[h2]REVENUE SHARE RESTRICTIONS[/h2]

[list]

[*]Please be aware that revenue shares cannot be changed once an item is submitted. If you have to change revenue shares on an unshipped item, you will need to do a new item submission and inform Valve of the new workshop URL so the correct workshop ID and revenue shares will be used for the item.  [/*]
[*]Revenue shares and the related accounts cannot be changed on an item after it ships. For more information about workshop payments, see the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/workshoppaymentinfofaq]Workshop Payment FAQ[/url]. [/*]
