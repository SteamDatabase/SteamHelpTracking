[h2]I'm concerned I may not be able to recover my account[/h2]

You can [b]always[/b] contact Steam Support for account recovery even if someone has changed the account's email address, password, and phone number.

If you're getting stuck in the recovery process, make sure you're entering the information Steam requests at each step. For example, when searching for an account, Steam's account recovery system asks for [b]your[/b] email address, not the account's current email address. Entering your email address as instructed for the search will help Steam identify your account, or present other options for locating an account if the email address has been changed.
