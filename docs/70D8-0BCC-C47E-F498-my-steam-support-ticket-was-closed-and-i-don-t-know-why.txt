[/section]

[h2]Closed by Your Choice[/h2]
When you access an open Steam Support ticket, you have the option to mark it as solved by closing it. It's suggested that you do not close a ticket yourself unless you're sure that the related problem is solved.

[h2]Closed Due to Inactivity[/h2]
A support ticket will close automatically if it has been waiting for your input for 14 days. Tickets will not automatically close if they're waiting to be addressed by a Steam Support agent.

[h2]Closed by a Steam Support Agent[/h2]
After addressing the problems that Steam Support can help you with, an agent may close the ticket. This typically happens when the problem has been solved, or the primary topic of the ticket lies outside of Steam Support's scope. Unless your messages include abuse such as harassment, spam, extreme vulgarity, or threats, a Steam Support agent will tell you when they're closing the ticket.

[h2]Closed by a Hijacker[/h2]
If a hijacker has access to your account or a machine that you've authorized to use it, they may access your Steam Support requests and close them. Hijackers most often gain access to an account through phishing websites disguised as Steam or gaming related websites.

There may be a [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/3195-9FFB-BA06-F25B]social engineering / scam[/url] component to these attacks. If someone is threatening your account or instructs you to chat with someone to resolve an issue, that's a scam.

If someone has access to your account and is closing your requests to try to make account recovery difficult, you can secure by following the advice in the [b]What should I do if I think my tickets are being closed maliciously?[/b] section below.

[h2]Can a Closed Ticket Be Reopened?[/h2]
Tickets closed by your own account can be reopened once. View the ticket and click the "Not you?" option to reopen it.

[section id=malclosed][h1]What should I do if I think my tickets are being closed maliciously?[/h1]
[/section]

[h2]If the ticket was submitted directly from your Steam account:[/h2]
To close a ticket, you must have access to the Steam account that created the ticket. If your tickets are being closed, someone else might have access to your login credentials or have remote or physicals access to your computer.

[h5]How to fix:[/h5]
Using Steam's [url=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=1266-OAFV-8478]Account Security Recommendations[/url] as a guide, secure your computer by scanning it for malware. Once you're sure that your computer is not infected with malware, secure your Steam account by updating its password to one that you haven't used previously and don't use with any other accounts. Updating your password will also force anyone who is logged in on a different computer to log in again, effectively removing any hijacker's access to the account.

After securing your Steam account, you can reopen the closed ticket using the "Not you?" option shown in the ticket. If you can't reopen the ticket, please submit a new one once you're sure your computer and accounts are secure.

[h2]If the ticket was submitted via email (account recovery tickets):[/h2]
To close a ticket submitted via email, the person closing the ticket needs access to it via the unique ticket access link that's sent to your email address when creating the ticket or whenever it is updated with a response from Steam Support. Some account recovery related ticket types cannot be closed.

[h5]How to fix:[/h5]
A ticket whose access link may have been viewed by a hijacker is not secure - the hijacker can view all of the messages in that ticket. If you think that a hijacker has been access your emails, or you've mistakenly provided a ticket access link to someone else, you should close any tickets that you submitted prior to securing your computer and email account.

In addition to our normal [url=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=1266-OAFV-8478]Account Security Recommendations[/url], make sure that the hijacker did not set up any forwarding rules to automatically forward support related emails to an email address of their own.

While it's not recommended that you abandon an email account to a hijacker, you may choose to create a new email account or use an alternate account to contact Steam Support while you take measures to secure or recover your original email account.

Once you're sure that your computer and email account are secure, submit a new ticket to the Steam Support team.
