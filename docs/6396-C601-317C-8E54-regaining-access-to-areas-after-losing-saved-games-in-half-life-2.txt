[h1]Regaining Access to Areas After Losing Saved Games in Half-Life 2[/h1]

[h2]What do I do if I deleted my saved games in Half-Life 2?
[/h2]

If you have deleted your saved games or have lost them for any other reason, you can do the following to regain access to the later chapters of the game:

First open the console (if this is not enabled you will need to do so by going to Options, going to the Keyboard tab, then Advanced, then placing a check next to Enable the Developers console), type in 'SV_Cheats 1' without the quotes and press enter, now type in 'SV_Unlockedchapters 15' without the quotes and press enter. You can now select New game from the main menu and choose the last chapter you played.
