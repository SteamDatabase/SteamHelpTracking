[h1]Steam and Games - Language Settings[/h1]

How can I change the language for Steam and my games?

[h4]Changing the language of the Steam client[/h4]
The Steam language setting determines which language the Steam client application displays, as well as the language which games are presented in. (Third-party titles may have their own language settings - these settings will generally be independent of the Steam language setting)

[olist]

[*]Log into your Steam account

[*]Click on "[b]Steam" [/b]in the top menu bar (this is in the very upper left of Steam on Windows, or in the menu bar above Steam on macOS)

[*]Go to the [b]Settings[/b] option ("Preferences" on macOS)

[*]Go to the [b]Interface[/b] tab

[*]Select the language you wish to use from the drop-down menu

[*]Click [b]OK[/b] and then select the option to [b]Restart Steam[/b]

[*]Once Steam restarts, you will be able to use Steam and Valve games in the language which you selected.

[*]If you have games installed that support the language you have selected, files for that language may need to be downloaded before you can play.

[h4]Shopping for games in other languages[/h4]

Within the Steam store, you can set secondary and additional language preferences which will make it easier to find games that are available in other languages. With these settings, the Steam store will be able to show you more information more likely to recommend and display games that are available in your language.

To set store language preferences, follow these instructions:

[olist]

[*]Log into your Steam account

[*]Click on your [b]profile name[/b] in the top menu bar (this is in the very upper right of Steam, next to your avatar)

[*]From that menu, select [b]Store Preferences[/b]

[*]On the left side of the preferences menu, select [b]Language Preferences[/b]

[*]Select the desired secondary or additional game content languages and hit [b]Save [/b]at the bottom of the page

[/olist]

[h4]Changing the language of the Steam Mobile App[/h4]

The [url=https://store.steampowered.com/mobile]Steam mobile app[/url] by default will follow the language setting you choose for your Steam desktop client. If you change the language setting for your Steam desktop client, you may need to restart the Steam mobile app before it updates to use the newly selected language.

If you wish to use a different language for the Steam mobile app, you can follow these instructions:

[olist]

[*]Click the three bars in the lower-right corner of the Steam mobile app. This opens the general app menu

[*]Click [b]Settings [/b]near the bottom of that app menu

[*]By default, the language setting will be set to "[b]Use Account Settings[/b]"

[*]Select that drop-down and choose your desired language. The mobile app will immediately refresh and display in the chosen language.

[/olist]

[h4]Changing the language of individual games[/h4]
The language of many games can be changed independently from the Steam client language.

[olist]

[*]Open your Steam Library [/*]
[*]Right click the game title and select [b]Properties...[/b]. [/*]
[*]Go to the [b]Language[/b] tab [/*]
[*]Select the language you wish to use from the drop-down menu [/*]
[*]If the game supports the language you have selected, files for that language may need to be downloaded before you can play. [/*]

[/olist]

If you are experiencing problems enabling a language, make sure your desired language is selected in both locations.

[section style=note]Some languages may not be available for the game you wish to play. Check the Steam store page for the game to see which languages are offered.
