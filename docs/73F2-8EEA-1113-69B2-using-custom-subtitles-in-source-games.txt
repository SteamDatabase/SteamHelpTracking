[h1]Using custom subtitles in Source games[/h1]

How do I install custom subtitles for any Source game?

[h2]Compiled (.DAT) Files[/h2]
If you already have a compiled [i][i]closecaption_[i]<language>[/i].dat[/i][/i] file, simply copy the file to the following location:

[i][b]NOTE:[/b] The [i]\\Steam\\[/i] folder is located in [i]C:\\Program Files\\[/i] or [i]C:\\Program Files (x86)\\[/i] by default.[/i]

[list]

[*]  		[i]\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\[game name]\\[modname]\\resource\\[/i]  	 [/*]

[/list]

For example, for Half-Life 2, the path would be:

[list]

[*]  		[i]\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Half-Life 2\\hl2\\resource\\[/i]  	 [/*]

[/list]

Then, start the game and ensure closed captioning is enabled in the Options > Audio menu.

To change to the custom language, open the [url=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=3041-SHZN-9384]console[/url] and enter the following command:

[list]

[*]  		cc_lang [i]<language>[/i]  	 [/*]

[/list]

Where [i]<language>[/i] is the same as the language in the closed caption file name.

[h2]Uncompiled (.TXT) Files[/h2]
Text files must be compiled before they will work with Source games. If you have a closecaption_[i]<language>[/i].txt file, then you will need to do the following to compile it:

[olist]

[*]  		Install the [url=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=1987-WYGJ-3701]Source SDK[/url] from the Tools section of the Steam Library.  	 [/*]
[*]  		Open the Source SDK launcher and ensure you have the correct game selected.  	 [/*]
[*]  		Navigate to the Source SDK [i]\\bin\\[/i] folder:

[list]

[*]  				[i]\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\SourceSDK\\bin\\[/i]  			 [/*]

[/list]
[/*]
[*]  		Determine which version of the Source engine the game uses, then open that folder. In most cases this will be [i]\\orangebox\\[/i]  	 [/*]
[*]  		Open the [i]\\bin\\[/i] subfolder of the engine folder. Inside this folder should be a program named [i]captioncompiler.exe[/i]  	 [/*]
[*]  		Take your closecaption_[i]<language>[/i].txt file, then drag it onto the [i]captioncompiler.exe[/i] program. A file called [i]closecaption_[i]<language>[/i].dat[/i] should appear — this is your compiled caption file.  	 [/*]
[*]  		Follow the instructions under [i][b]Compiled (.DAT) Files[/b][/i] using this file.  	 [/*]

[/olist]

[h2]Creating Translations[/h2]
If you would like to translate closed captions into your own language, please see the following Valve Developer Wiki article on this topic:
