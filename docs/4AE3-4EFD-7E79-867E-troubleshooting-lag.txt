[h4]Check Server Latency[/h4]
If you are attempting to connect to a server that is geographically distant or if you are not using a high-speed connection it is important to check the server's Latency (this will appear to the left of the window in the server browser).

Latency represents the amount of time it takes information to reach the server from your machine - higher latency means a greater likelihood of lag. [/*]
[*]

[h4]Check Content Server Region[/h4]
Games such as Left 4 Dead automatically detect which region you are in, helping to determine the best server to connect you to.  You can double-check your region by starting Steam, going to [b]Steam[/b] > [b]Settings[/b] > [b]Downloads[/b] tab and under [b]Download region  [/b]and selecting the region that you are in or the one closest to you.

[h4]Examine Background Applications and Running Processes[/h4]
Background applications - especially programs which require bandwidth (chat clients, FTP programs, web browsers, etc) - may contribute to choppy gameplay, a low framerate, and other symptoms of lag.

Please see the [url=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=9828-SFLZ-9289]Programs Which May Interfere with Steam[/url] topic for instructions to disable any unnecessary background applications before loading Steam. [/*]

[h4]Optimize Router Settings and Environment[/h4]
It is important to maintain an appropriate environment for your router and other electronics. Ideally, your router should be in a well-ventilated area where it will not overheat. Overheating routers have been reported to cause network connectivity issues and symptoms of lag.

In addition to ensuring your router is operating at optimum levels, it may be useful to forward gaming-related ports to your machine if you are the only user on your home network who will be playing Steam games. Please see the [url=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=1456-EUDN-2493#ports]Required Ports for Steam[/url] list to see which Steam and game ports to forward. [/*]
