[h2]How do I sign-up for a Dota TV league ticket?[/h2]
You can sign-up for a Dota TV league ticket by visiting the league sign-up page [url=http://www.dota2.com/leagues]here[/url]. Once you complete the form you will be redirected to your league admin page. On your admin page you will need to upload your league images in order for us to be able to build and complete your ticket. Once you are comfortable with the information you provided for your league you will need to "Publish" your league. When "Publishing" your league, you verify all the information has been entered and is correct. Once your league is "Published" you will be unable to edit the information you provided for your league. You must "Publish" your league at least 7 days prior to the start date of your event. If you fail to publish your league 7 days prior to the start date of your league, your league will be rejected.
