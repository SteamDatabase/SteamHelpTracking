[h2]How do I request a refund?[/h2]

All refund requests are handled through [url=https://help.steampowered.com]help.steampowered.com[/url].

For a step-by-step guide, please see our [url=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=6695-QIKM-7966]How To Request A Refund[/url] FAQ.

[h2]What can I request a refund for?[/h2]

Valve will, upon request via [url=https://help.steampowered.com]help.steampowered.com[/url], issue a refund for any title that is requested within 14 days of purchase and has been played for less than 2 hours (this includes online, offline and shared library playtime). Even if you fall outside of the refund rules we've described, you can submit a request and we'll take a look at it.

[h2]Where is my refund? My refund was approved, but it’s been more than 7 days.[/h2]

Approved refunds can take up to 7 days to appear in your account – however, refunds to international payment methods may take longer. If your refund hasn’t appeared after 7 days, please contact your bank directly and ask about pending refunds on your account.

[section style=note]When a refund request is approved within 24 hours of the purchase, the original transaction is cancelled and the charge drops off your bank statement. In this case, you will not see a credit on your account. This process can take up to 10 days – wait time for international payment methods may vary.

[h2]Is there a limit to how many purchases I can request a refund for?[/h2]
