[h1]Addressing abuse, harassment and other misconduct on Steam[/h1]

Several options are available to address abusive or inappropriate behaviors encountered while using Steam. There are also practices to keep in mind that can help you avoid these types of behaviors altogether.

If you are ever experiencing abuse outside of Steam, or if you ever feel that your safety is being threatened, we strongly encourage contacting local emergency or law enforcement services in your area.

[h2]What Options Are Available?[/h2]

There are different ways to address problematic behavior from other players. You'll want to use the options that make the most sense for your situation. We are always interested in hearing about your experience, so if an option is missing, let us know.

[h3]Reporting Content[/h3]

If another player is hosting content that is being used in an abusive or inappropriate manner, we encourage players to utilize our reporting system. Reports are reviewed and typically resolved within 24 hours of submission. You will receive a notification if action is taken.

[h2]Best Practices[/h2]

We always recommend that players engage in responsible behavior while using Steam. Doing so will decrease the likelihood of your account being the target of malicious activities.

[list]

[*]

[h3]Keep Your Personal Info Safe[/h3]

Malicious activity often relies on access to your personal information. Never post personally identifiable information on Steam, even in private chats or other areas that you might think are safe. Someone else can always decide to make this content public.

You should also review your Steam [url=https://steamcommunity.com/my/edit/settings]privacy options[/url] and be aware of what components of your profile are public.

[*]

[h3]Protect Your Account[/h3]

Account security is something that you can control. Take advantage of Steam's security features and never let anyone access or borrow your account, regardless of the reason.

You can find more information and resources in our dedicated [url=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=1266-OAFV-8478]Account Security Recommendations[/url] article.

[*]

[h3]Engage In Responsible Steam Behavior[/h3]

Make sure that you are following the Steam [url=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=4045-USHJ-3810]Rules & Guidelines[/url] and that you are not engaging in activities that violate the Steam subscriber agreement. Activities like this will potentially expose your account to other bad actors, making it a target of malicious activity.

[*]

[h3]Unfriending and Leaving Groups[/h3]

Don't participate in groups or befriend users that are involved in harassment, scamming, or other malicious activities. Associating with players or groups that are involved in inappropriate activity will increase the likelihood that you become a target.

[*]

[h3]Don’t Engage The Other Party[/h3]

Whether it's scamming, harassment, spamming or any other malicious activity, do not engage the party that is responsible. A reaction typically results in even more dedication to the activity by the other party. We recommend ignoring the behavior and utilizing the appropriate resources outlined in this FAQ.
