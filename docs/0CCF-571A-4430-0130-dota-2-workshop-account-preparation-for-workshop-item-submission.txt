[img]http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/workshop/guidelines/workshop_banner.jpg[/img]

These instructions will help community contributors set up the accounts and tools required for submitting items to the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/570/workshop/]Dota 2 Item Workshop[/url].

There are numerous steps involved with this process but most will only have to be done once to set up a Steam account that can make Workshop submissions. Please be aware that after you submit tax information, the processing and verification may take a few days.

22. If you are making an item in collaboration with Valve, please notify your Valve contact via email of the item ID url of your submission so we can prepare it for shipping in game.

23.  If you want the item to be visible on the Workshop for marketing purposes and to gather votes you should make the item public and add a YouTube video and images of the in-game items. For example, a music pack could have a video with samples of the tracks and a hero set could show various views of the items on the hero in the loadout and while performing actions in-game.

[h2]ADDING ANOTHER ENTITY TO SHARE ITEM REVENUE[/h2]
24. IMPORTANT:  Adding Another User (Optional)

[list]

[*]If you are splitting payments with another entity for your item you need to add their Steam account as a friend to your account. [/*]
[*]If they have never accepted the Workshop agreement they must go through steps 1-19 above to be set up as a collaborator. [/*]

[/list]

Here is how to add a friend on Steam:

25. If the user you want to split payments with is not in your friends list, have them provide you their Steam Profile URL.

26. From their Steam Profile page you can click the "Add Friend" button to add them to your friends list. You will have to wait until they have accepted your friend invite before you can continue.

27. Go to the Dota 2 Workshop

[url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/570/workshop/]http://steamcommunity.com/app/570/workshop/[/url]

28. Select "Files you've posted"

30.  In the Workshop Item Revenue Sharing section change your percentage to the proper amount and then select "Add Another User" and select their SteamID.

[h2]FINALIZING YOUR SUBMISSION TO THE DOTA 2 WORKSHOP[/h2]
33. Click Save to finalize your submission.

NOTE: Revenue shares cannot be changed on an item once it has been submitted. If revenue shares need to change before an item ships, a new submission will be necessary.

34. If you review your submitted item in the workshop and the item link shows an error message saying "Sorry, An error was encountered while processing your request: That item does not exist. It may have been removed by the author.", check these two things:

[list]

[*]Make sure you are logged in under the account that submitted the item if it is a hidden item.  [/*]
