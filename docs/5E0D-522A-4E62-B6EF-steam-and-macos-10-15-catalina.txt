[h2]Will Steam continue to work after macOS 10.15 Catalina?[/h2]

Yes, there is now a Steam application that is 64-bit. Please download it [url=https://store.steampowered.com/about/ ]here[/url].

[i]Please note:[/i] If you are running macOS 10.15 Catalina or newer you will be able to buy and play Mac applications that are 64-bit only.

[i]See additional ways to play 32-bit Mac apps below.[/i]

[h2]What is happening with 32-bit Mac apps?[/h2]

Apple ended support for 32-bit Mac applications with their release of macOS Catalina 10.15.

See their support article [url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208436]here[/url].

[h2]Can I keep playing my Mac games that I purchased that are 32-bit?[/h2]

Yes. You will still have access to your 32-bit Mac games in your Steam Library. We are not removing these games from your library and they will continue to work on macOS 10.14 Mojave and earlier, Windows and in many cases Linux as well.

[h2]What are my options to make sure I can continue to play my 32-bit Mac apps?[/h2]

There are several options that will allow you to keep playing your 32-bit Mac apps. The good news is we have Steam Play, which means that when you purchased your game on Steam you get a copy of this game on each OS that game supports. You will still be able to play these games on macOS 10.14 Mojave and earlier, Windows and in many cases Linux as well.

Options to keep 32-bit Mac games playable on a Mac computer:

[list]

[*]Consider not upgrading to macOS 10.15 or above. By staying on macOS 10.14 Mojave or older you will ensure that your 32-bit apps are still playable on your Mac computer.
[*]After upgrading to macOS 10.15 Catalina, consider installing macOS 10.14 Mojave on a separate APFS volume on your computer along with Steam. This will allow you to flip over to macOS 10.14 on restart of your computer where you can continue to play all of your 32-bit Mac games.
