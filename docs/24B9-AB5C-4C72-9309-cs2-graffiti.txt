[h2]How do I get in-game graffiti?[/h2]
There are three ways players can get in-game graffiti:

[list]

[*] Players with Prime Status can choose graffiti from their weekly care package.

[*] Graffiti Boxes featuring art created by Steam Community Artists can be purchased. A portion of the proceeds from sales of Community Graffiti Boxes is shared among the community artists.

[*] Individual graffiti patterns can be purchased from the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/market/search?category_730_ItemSet%5B%5D=any&category_730_ProPlayer%5B%5D=any&category_730_StickerCapsule%5B%5D=any&category_730_TournamentTeam%5B%5D=any&category_730_Weapon%5B%5D=any&appid=730&q=graffiti]Steam Community Market[/url].

[/list]

[section id=graffititypes]

[h2]How many different types of graffiti are there?[/h2]
There are two different types of graffiti patterns; monochrome and multi-colored. Monochrome (one color) patterns are received as rank up drops and multi-colored patterns are received when purchasing a graffiti box. Both types of graffiti can be traded and sold on the Steam Community Market.
[/section]

[section id=graffitiuses]

[h2]How many times can I use a graffiti pattern?[/h2]
When a player unseals graffiti they can apply that pattern 50 times. Players who unseal a graffiti pattern they already have in their Inventory will receive 50 additional charges to their existing supply.
[/section]

[section id=graffitigone]

[h2]My graffiti disappeared from my Inventory. Where did it go?[/h2]
There are two reasons graffiti may disappear from your Inventory:

[list]

[*]All of the graffiti's charges were used.

[*]The graffiti was deleted from your Inventory.
[/list]
Consumed and/or deleted graffiti cannot be restored. If you would like more charges you may purchase them through the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/market/search?category_730_ItemSet%5B%5D=any&category_730_ProPlayer%5B%5D=any&category_730_StickerCapsule%5B%5D=any&category_730_TournamentTeam%5B%5D=any&category_730_Weapon%5B%5D=any&appid=730&q=graffiti]Steam Community Market[/url].
[/section]

[section id=graffittitime]

[h2]How often can I apply graffiti?[/h2]
Players can apply graffiti once per round, or every 45 seconds, whichever is shorter. Getting a kill in a round-based game mode will allow the player to apply more graffiti.
[/section]

[section id=graffitilength]

[h2]How long does my graffiti last?[/h2]
One application of graffiti lasts 7 minutes and degrades over time until it is no longer visible.
[/section]

[section id=graffitizone]

[h2]Where can I apply graffiti?[/h2]
The graffiti preview shows where and how the graffiti pattern will be applied. If there is no preview then the surface does not support graffiti.
[/section]

[section id=graffitinumber]

[h2]How many different graffiti patterns can I have equipped at once?[/h2]
Players can have as many different graffiti patterns equipped as they want and can use the in-game graffiti menu to select and apply a different graffiti pattern at every application.
[/section]

[section id=graffiticheck]

[h2]How do I see my available graffiti?[/h2]
All graffiti patterns can be viewed in players' inventories and in the in-game graffiti menu.
[/section]

[section id=graffitimarket]

[h2]Can I sell and trade my graffiti?[/h2]
Graffiti can be sold on the Steam Community Market and traded as long as it is sealed. Once a player has unsealed their graffiti it can not be traded or sold on the Steam Community Market.
[/section]

[section id=graffitidelete]

[h2]Can I delete graffiti from my Inventory?[/h2]
Yes, but the graffiti must be unsealed. Once you have unsealed the graffiti, locate the item in your Counter-Strike 2 inventory, right click on it, then select 'Delete Item'.
