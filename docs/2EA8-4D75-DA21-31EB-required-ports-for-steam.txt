[h3]Note:[/h3]
Many university and business networks and proxies block required ports for Steam operation - please consult your network administrator to ensure the required ports are open if you are using a university/business network or a proxy. [b]Ports required for Steam can not be re-mapped to HTTP or reconfigured to a custom port range.[/b]

For generic Steam HTTP/HTTPS requests, your proxy should allow the following domains:

[list]

[*]steampowered.com [/*]
[*]steamcommunity.com [/*]
[*]steamgames.com [/*]
[*]steamusercontent.com [/*]
[*]steamcontent.com [/*]
[*]steamstatic.com [/*]
[*]akamaihd.net [/*]

[/list]

Most of the non-web traffic is usually UDP but can be TCP as well. For that, the IPs will all be from the Valve network (AS32590), and a list of those IP blocks can be found here:

[list]

[*][url=https://as32590.net/ipv4.txt]IPv4[/url] [/*]
[*][url=https://as32590.net/ipv6.txt]IPv6[/url] [/*]
