Any user who wants to hold more than 1,000 items in their Counter-Strike 2 Inventory will need a Storage Unit. Even if you have not reached the 1,000 item Inventory limit, Storage Units can be labeled and used as a way to more effectively organize your Counter-Strike 2 Inventory.

[section id=whereretrieve]

[h2]I retrieved an item but can not find it in my Inventory. Where did it go?[/h2]
When items are retrieved from a Storage Unit they are added back to your Counter-Strike 2 Inventory in the same location they were prior to being deposited. Retrieved items will not appear at the top of your Counter-Strike 2 Inventory.

If you can not find the retrieved item we suggest scrolling through your Inventory or searching for the item using 'Search Items'. It is not possible to lose items you are depositing or retrieving from Storage Units because they never leave your account.
[/section]

[section id=interactsu]

[h2]How can I interact with items placed in a Storage Unit?[/h2]
Any item in a Storage Unit cannot be equipped, consumed, traded, marketed, renamed, or altered until it is retrieved to your Inventory.
[/section]

[section id=tradesu]

[h2]Can I trade or market items in a Storage Unit?[/h2]
No, you would need to take the items out of the Storage Unit first. Storage Units are singular in purpose and only meant for holding items. If your Storage Unit is empty it can be deleted in-game.
[/section]

[section id=renamesu]

[h2]How often can I rename a Storage Unit?[/h2]
Storage Units can be renamed as often as you would like. To rename a Storage Unit click on it in your Inventory and select 'Change Label'.
