[h1][b]SteamOS / Steam Machine FAQ[/b][/h1]

[h2]SteamOS[/h2]

[expand type=title title="What is SteamOS?"]

SteamOS is our Linux-based operating system. The base system draws from Debian 8, code named Debian Jessie. Our work builds on top of the solid Debian core and optimizes it for a living room experience. Most of all, it’s an open Linux platform that gives you full control. You can take charge of your system and install the software and content that you want.

[expand type=title title="“SteamOS is attempting to recover from a fatal error”"]

This error shows up if SteamOS fails to start the graphics driver and boot Steam. It can happen after a failed update, or if you have conflicting packages installed. The update installer should self-fix, but if you end up in a never-ending loop, try restoring from recovery and re-updating without cutting power. If all else fails, factory resetting your Steam Machine will fix the issue.

[expand type=title title="What is a Steam Machine?"]

A Steam Machine is a compact gaming computer that’s built for playing Steam games on SteamOS. Learn to [url=http://store.steampowered.com/steamos/]build your own.[/url]

[expand type=title title="Do Steam Machines use game discs?"]

No; just like a desktop computer, a Steam Machine downloads games from your Steam account (learn about Steam [url=http://store.steampowered.com/about/]here[/url]) and installs them directly onto its hard drive. For this reason, you must have an internet connection to get the full gaming experience.

[/expand]

[expand type=title title="Do I need a Steam Controller to use a Steam Machine?"]

You can use any USB input device, including keyboard and mouse, various gamepads, Steam Controllers, etc. Keep in mind that each Steam game is different in its controller requirements – in other words, not all games on Steam can be played with a gamepad.
