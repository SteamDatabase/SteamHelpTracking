[h1]Team Fortress 2 - Free to Play[/h1]

What do I need to know about Team Fortress 2 Free to Play?

[h2]For new players:[/h2]
[b]Q. Who has a free account?[/b]

Anyone who has downloaded the game for free and has not made a purchase in the in-game Mann Co. Store has a free account.

[b]Q. Who has a premium account?[/b]

If you've ever spent money on Team Fortress 2, you have a premium account. This includes purchasing the game before it was Free-To-Play, receiving the game as a gift that was purchased, activating a retail version, or making a purchase in the Mann Co. in-game store.

[b]Q. How is a free account different than a premium account?[/b]

Premium accounts have a few extra features including access to rare and cosmetic items through random item drops, 300 backpack slots to start compared to 50 for free accounts, and more powerful trading and crafting abilities. Otherwise, however, the gameplay experience will be identical for both accounts.
