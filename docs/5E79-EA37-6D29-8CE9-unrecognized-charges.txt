[h1]Unrecognized Charges[/h1]

[h4]I have charges from Valve Software, Steampowered.com, or Steam Games that I do not recognize, what should I do? [/h4]

We recommend checking with other members of your household, or anyone that may have had access to your payment method, to determine who may have made these purchases. Valve has no recurring fees or monthly charges unless otherwise explicitly stated as part of an online game subscription. Any charges from our company are for computer games, DLC (downloadable content for a game), or in-game items/currency.  If you determine that a a member of your household completed the purchases without your permission, you can still contact Steam Support for assistance.

If you own a Steam account, we also recommend checking your purchase history. You can review your Steam Store purchase history from the [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/]Help Site[/url] or the Steam Client. After logging into your account, click on your account name at the top right of the screen and select [i]Account Details > View purchase history[/i]. If the total sum displayed in your purchase history does not match what you see on your bank statement or invoice, get in touch with your payment provider. In some countries, banks may add additional processing fees, taxes, or conversion charges to the final total, even if you made the purchase on Steam with your local currency. Steam does not control these fees.
