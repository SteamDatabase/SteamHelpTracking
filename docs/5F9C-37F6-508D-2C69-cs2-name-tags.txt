[h2]What are Name Tags?[/h2]
Name Tags are single use items which allow players to nickname their weapons. Name Tags cannot be modified once they have been applied and are not returned to the user's Inventory when removed.

To remove a Name Tag on an existing weapon, left-click on the weapon, select 'Rename', then 'Remove Name'.

Name Tags can be purchased for $1.99 USD in-game or from the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/market/]Steam Community Market[/url].
