[h1]How to remotely manage your library using  Steam’s Remote Downloads feature[/h1]

Remote Downloads are enabled from any web browser or from the Steam Mobile app when you leave the Steam application running on your PC or Mac. Of course, we only recommend you do this on your own private, secured computer.

When you’re logged into Steam on your home PC or Mac, you can manage your library by visiting your Games list on the web.

[*]This will take you to your "Recently Played" tab or "All Games" tab. Select the "All Games" tab. If you’re logged into the Steam client elsewhere, the games list will reflect the installation state of your library on that machine.   Next, locate your game and tap the install button to initiate your remote download. [img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/1976/cdbecda575badbebadbb0309fe036656b4e1865c.png[/img]

You may choose to refresh this page to check the current status of your installation. When you return to your active client session, your game will be ready to play!
