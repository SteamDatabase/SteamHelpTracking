[h1]Buying or selling a Steam account[/h1]

[h2]Can I buy or sell my Steam account?[/h2]
Steam accounts cannot be bought or sold. An account is for the personal use of its creator only.

[h2]What are the consequences of selling an account?[/h2]
When Steam's support team notices an account has been sold, the account will be permanently locked whether or not it is currently in the possession of the buyer or seller.

[h2]What are the consequences of buying an account?[/h2]
If you buy and use an account, you risk losing access to the account at any time with no option to recover it. When this happens, you'll also lose any value you've added to the account including but not limited to:

[list]

[*]Rank, playtime, and stats [/*]
[*]Purchases or activated games [/*]
[*]Inventory items purchased or acquired through gameplay [/*]

[/list]

[h2]I've been using a purchased account and just learned I shouldn't. What should I do?[/h2]
It's important that you understand Steam's rules, which can be found in the [url=https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/]Steam Subscriber Agreement.[/url]

If you've made a mistake by buying an account and wish to rectify it to the best of your ability, you should switch to using an account you've personally created and cease using the purchased account entirely.
