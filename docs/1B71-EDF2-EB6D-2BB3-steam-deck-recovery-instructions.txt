[h2]Factory Reset[/h2]

For situations where you want to clear all local data (including games, etc.) and reinstall Steam/SteamOS, you can make use of this feature.

This option can be used if your Deck can boot successfully into Steam.

[olist]

[*]While in Steam, press the "Steam" button, go to "Settings" and then "System".

[*]From there scroll down to the Factory Reset option and select the "Factory Reset" button.

Note: The 'Re-install SteamOS' option may require an active internet connection. If a system file has been modified, this operation will download the original version to restore them to an unmodified state. If you cannot or do not want to connect the device to the internet, you can disable the 'Re-install SteamOS' option or use the [url=#menu]"Rollback to previous OS"[/url] option to revert to the previous version of SteamOS.

[h2]Erase user data from Deck[/h2]

This option is useful if you want to erase all local user data on the Deck but do not want to, or cannot load into game mode to use the Factory Reset option to erase it. Accessing this menu requires specific button presses and for the device to be completely shut down.

[h2]Rollback to previous OS[/h2]

SteamOS for Deck has the ability to recover to a last known good version of the Operating System (OS) while retaining user data (e.g. installed games, saves, etc.). This can be useful for situations where you believe some recent modification in the OS may have caused an issue, or you suspect you have corrupted data in your current OS and want to retain your user data.

To roll back to the previous OS, see the instructions below:

[h2]Recovery via Image[/h2]

The following instructions are for how to recover, repair, or re-image your Steam Deck using the SteamOS image. This method will clear all data on the device and then install SteamOS.

[olist]

[*] Download the recovery image [url=https://store.steampowered.com/steamos/download/?ver=steamdeck]here (click)[/url].

[*] Prepare a USB key (8GB minimum) with the recovery image:

[list]

[*] On [b]Windows [/b]we recommend using the [url=https://rufus.ie/en/]Rufus utility[/url]. Select the recovery file and write it to your USB drive (this will format the contents of your USB drive). When it's done, select 'Close' and eject the drive.

[*] On [b]MacOS [/b]you can use [url=https://www.balena.io/etcher/]Balena Etcher[/url] to write the recovery file to your USB drive.

[*] On [b]Linux [/b]you can also use [url=https://www.balena.io/etcher/]Balena Etcher[/url] to write the recovery file to your USB drive - or if you prefer you can do this directly from the command line:
[code]bzcat steamdeck-recovery-4.img.bz2 | sudo dd if=/dev/stdin of=/dev/sdX oflag=sync status=progress bs=128M[/code] (set /dev/sdX to the USB device you inserted)
[/list]

[*] Use a USB-C adapter or hub to plug the boot disk in.

[*] Shut down your Steam Deck if it isn't already off. Hold 'Volume Down' and click the Power Button - when you hear the chime, let go of the Volume Down button, and you'll be booted into the Boot Manager.

[*] In the Boot Manager, boot from the 'EFI USB Device' (your USB key)

[*] The screen will go dark while it's booting - give it a minute.

[*] Once booted you will be in a desktop environment, you can navigate using the trackpad and trigger.
