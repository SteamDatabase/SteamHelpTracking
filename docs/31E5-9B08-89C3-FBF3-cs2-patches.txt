[h2]What are Patches?[/h2]
Patches in Counter-Strike 2 are single use in-game items that can be applied to any non-default Agent you own in different locations.

Once applied, a Patch’s location cannot be changed; the Patch can only be removed from the Agent. Like Stickers on a weapon, any Patches applied to an Agent will remain if it is bought or sold on the Steam Community Market.

[h2]I have applied a Patch and would like to move it. Can I do this?[/h2]
No. Once a Patch has been applied it cannot be moved. If you would like to remove a Patch you will need to click ‘REMOVE PATCH’ in-game.

[b]Note:[/b] Removing a Patch from an Agent is permanent and the Patch will not be returned to your Inventory.

[h2]Which Agents can I apply Patches to?[/h2]
Patches can be applied to any Agent you own but cannot be applied to default (local) agents.
