[h4]Gold Source games (Counter-Strike, Half-Life)[/h4]
If you cannot switch your weapon to the right-hand, please go to your advanced video options and change the renderer to either [b]OpenGL[/b] or [b]Direct3D[/b]. The software renderer does not support right-handed models.

You can select left or right-handed models by typing the following command into the [url=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=3041-SHZN-9384]Console[/url]:

[list]

[*]To use your left-hand: [code]cl_righthand 0[/code] [/*]
[*]To use your right-hand: [code]cl_righthand 1[/code] [/*]

[/list]

To permanently use left-handed models, you may create a [b]userconfig.cfg[/b] file with the [code]cl_righthand 0[/code] command. Please follow these instructions to create a userconfig.cfg file:

[olist]

[*]Locate the subfolder in your game folder that holds the [b]config.cfg[/b] file

For example, you can find the config.cfg file for Counter-Strike at [Steam installation directory]\\steamapps\\common\\Counter-Strike\\cstrike\\config.cfg [/*]
[*]Create a new text file in that directory called [b]userconfig.cfg[/b] [/*]
[*]Open the file with Notepad and enter [code]cl_righthand 1[/code] (to use the right-handed model) or [code]cl_righthand 0[/code] (to use the left-handed model) [/*]
[*]Save the file [/*]
[*]Launch the game to test the userconfig.cfg settings [/*]

[/olist]
