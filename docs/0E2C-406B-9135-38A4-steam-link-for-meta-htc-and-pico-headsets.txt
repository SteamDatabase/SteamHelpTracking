[expand type=title title="Frequently Asked Questions"]

[h4]How can I improve the streaming quality?[/h4]

In our testing, the majority of people have found that switching to a 5GHz network significantly improves the experience.

You can find out more information about improving wireless streaming  [url=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=4950-EBNM-7843]here[/url].

[h4]Why does my wi-fi indicator display an exclamation mark?[/h4]

Your wireless network is on 2.4Ghz and not 5Ghz.

[h4]How do I join the Quest Public Beta Client?[/h4]

To join, you must install Steam Link to your Meta headset, then you can opt into the Public Beta channel using this link https://www.meta.com/s/1hti7gedQ from your phone, or by using the Meta application on your phone to select the Public Beta channel in the settings for the Steam Link application.

Note that there is no PICO or HTC Public Beta program available at this time.

[h4]Can I use my Wi-Fi network to connect to my PC and my headset?[/h4]

Using a wireless connection to your PC is not advised and could cause connectivity failures and other latency issues. We recommend a wired connection to your PC, and a 5GHz WiFi network for your headset is highly recommended.

[h4]What operating systems can I use for streaming VR?[/h4]

Windows 10 and Windows 11 are fully supported. There is experimental Linux support. Other operating systems such as macOS are not supported.

[h4]Experimental Linux Support[/h4]

Steam Link VR Uses Vulkan Video, and driver support for Vulkan Video is only available in the newest drivers.  Please use NVIDIA drivers 575.64.05 or newer or if AMD, please use Mesa drivers 25.2.2 or newer.

[h4]Does Steam Link support AMD GPUs for my PC?[/h4]

Some AMD GPUs are experimentally supported.

[list]

[expand type=title title="Troubleshooting"]

[h4]If you cannot connect make sure:[/h4]

[*]Your computer is on and running Steam

[*]You’ve created and logged into your Steam account on your computer

[*]Your computer is connected to the same network as your headset

[*]You have enabled Remote Play in your Steam Settings on your desktop

[*]You have checked your computer for any issues being presented in the SteamVR window

[*]Your computer’s network is set to "Private" instead of "Public" NOTE: Sometimes anti-virus software or other applications will change this without notice.

[*]You’ve disabled all VPNs before streaming

[*]Try temporarily disabling your firewall to identify whether that is causing problems

[*]You do not have another wired HMD connected to your PC (If using Controller Wireless Receiver on Index/Vive, DO NOT plug in HDMI/DisplayPort to GPU)

[*]You are on the newest GPU drivers, for NVIDIA there are known issues with driver versions older than 546.29

[*]Make sure you are not connecting to a "guest" wireless network. For instance, the 'xfinitywifi' SSID of your router. Only connecting to the Wi-Fi SSID associated with your LAN will work.

[*]If you are using a Lenovo product, disable "Network Booster"

[*]Any default on devices, like "AMD ReLive for VR Redirect" are disabled or removed as they will prevent Steam Link from running in SteamVR.

[*]You are on the newest SteamVR version (Pre-2.2 versions may not function)

[*]You have tried disabling mesh features in your router, as sometimes they interfere with Steam Link.

[*]If you must use mesh networks (please be aware we do not officially support mesh networks), connect your PC to the mesh node you intend to use with your headset.
Also, "bind" your headset to the AP you intend to use in the mesh network's admin panel or companion application.  This process will vary depending on your specific network.

[*]If using AMD, disable the "Instant Reply" feature if it is in use.  Some users report that this prevents Steam Link from launching.

[h4]If you are experiencing performance issues:[/h4]

[*]Use only a wired connection, (gigabit min.), between your computer and your router

[*]Using a wireless connection to your PC is not advised and could cause connectivity failures and other latency issues

[*]If using screen recording or streaming software like OBS or Discord, make sure to use software encoding inside the software application otherwise it will preempt Steam Link

[*]Unsupported Network Types:  Mesh networks, Multiple AP networks with the same SSID or channel

[*]Try moving closer to your router

[*]If you are in an area with a lot of Wi-Fi interference, move your router to another location to minimize the interference of other networks.

[*]Try toggling the wifi off and on in headset under with wifi menu with the toggle at the top right

[*]Make sure your Wi-Fi network is 5GHz or higher

[*]Try changing the channel on your Wi-Fi router

[*]Set your Wi-Fi channel width to 80MHz or 160MHz. Using 20MHz and 40MHz channels may cause problems

[*]Try disconnecting all other devices from your router to identify the device that is causing problems

[*]Make sure you are on the newest GPU drivers, for NVIDIA there are known issues with driver versions older than 546.29

[*]Make sure your Encode Width is set to <1280 since many headsets cannot decode higher encode resolutions at >90 Hz

[*]Sometimes wireless routers become unstable, try rebooting your wireless router

[*]Be sure that you are using "Auto" bandwidth in Steam VR -> Steam Link settings, instead of manual. "Auto" specifically targets bandwidth to help avoid jitters.

[*](For Quest users) Especially if you see brightness issues, try disabling power saver in your Meta Quest Settings under "Settings" -> "System" -> "Power" -> "Battery Saver"

[*]If you are using a Lenovo product, disable "Network Booster"

[h4]If you are having microphone issues:[/h4]

[*]Check that the microphone is not muted in-headset

[*]Use the speaker icon on the SteamVR dashboard to turn the microphone volume to maximum

[*]Verify the Steam Streaming Microphone is enabled in your audio device settings under "Sound Settings" in Windows

[*]Select Steam Streaming Microphone in Sound Properties in Windows, and enter device properties. Verify that the microphone slider is set to 80% or higher

[*]Try setting "HMD" or "Steam Streaming Microphone" as the audio output device in "Audio Settings" in SteamVR Setting. Note that the default should be "HMD"

[*]Verify Steam Link has permissions to use the microphone in the Settings Menu, under "Apps" (App Permissions), under "Microphone" and verify the slider is slid to enable

[h4]If you are having speaker issues:[/h4]

[*]Check that Steam Streaming Speakers is enabled (both as an audio input and audio output device) in your audio device settings under "Sound Settings"

[*]Check that your headset volume is not set low on the headset, itself by either sliding the volume slider in SteamVR or in-headset

[*]Try setting "HMD" or "Steam Streaming Speakers" as the audio output device in "Audio Settings" in SteamVR Setting. Note that the default should be "HMD"

[h4]Steam dashboard not opening:[/h4]

[*]To open the Steam dashboard, click the menu button on the left controller, which is the default binding. Ensure that the controller bindings are correct.

[*]Ensure that the setting "VR Dashboard on System Button" is ON. This should be on by default. To manage this setting go to: SteamVR Settings > Dashboard then Toggle the Advanced Settings button.

[*]Try disconnecting other VR controllers connected to your PC.

[h4]OpenXR Application Runtime Issues[/h4]

If you are running OpenXR applications, and you previously were using a different runtime, for instance Windows Mixed Reality, Oculus OpenXR Runtime or Virtual desktop OpenXR Runtime, in order to use OpenXR applications with Steam Link, you will need to change your system's OpenXR runtime to SteamVR.  You can do this by starting SteamVR, selecting the settings menu by opening the menu at the top left of the SteamVR window, then selecting the "OpenXR" tab. From there you can configure SteamVR to be your system default OpenXR runtime.

[h4]Foveation[/h4]

For most users, we recommend our automatic settings. By default, Steam Link applies settings for an optimal experience based on your PC, headset and network conditions.

For advanced users who need more control, please be aware of the following.

[b]Foveation Size is affected by the following settings:[/b]

[list]

[*] Render Resolution - available in General and Video settings

[olist]

[*] Larger values may result in a smaller than desired foveated region

[*] Recommend no higher than 175%

[/olist]

[*] Encoded Video Size – available  in Steam Link settings

[olist]

[*] Larger values will cause latency and frame drops when decoded on your headset

[*] Recommend no higher than 1280 encode size

[*] Some GPUs do not support encode sizes > 1024

[/olist]

[/list]

[h4]Bandwidth[/h4]

Steam Link dynamically selects a bandwidth that favors a smooth, low latency experience based on your current network conditions and frame rate when set to "Auto". If your content has a low frame rate, Steam Link will automatically adjust the bandwidth.

Manually increasing bandwidth beyond the default may cause jitter and frame drops. Decreasing it may yield a smoother experience but at the cost of more video artifacts.

As the Steam Link team obtains additional data and improves the video encode and decode, we will continue to tune and improve the "Automatic" settings.
