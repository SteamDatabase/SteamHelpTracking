[h1]Antivirus software reports Steam games are malicious[/h1]

Steam or a game is being flagged by my anti-virus software as malware.

[section style=important]

[h3]Important:[/h3]
Virus and malware protection should be taken very seriously. False positive detections are extremely common, but players should still take precaution any time your trusted anti-virus provider detects a problem.

Many anti-virus software providers have a 'Game Mode' or allow players to create exclusions for game files or processes when experiencing confirmed false positives or interference.

If you are not confident it is a false positive, the first thing you'll want to do is report the app in question by navigating to the storepage and selecting the blue flag on the right-side of the storepage.

Please provide details about what happened, including the anti-virus software that flagged the malware and what type of malware was flagged. Steam uses these reports to identify when content should be reviewed.

Next, we encourage you to contact your anti-virus provider for more information and instructions on how to protect your computer while avoiding false positive detections.

If you are sure that the file is not malware, you can create an exception in your anti-virus software to successfully install and launch the product.

You can also reach out to Steam Support for more information and to follow up on your report.

If you had to create exclusions for files that your antivirus software was deleting or corrupting, you can restore deleted or corrupted game installation files by following the instructions to [url=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2037-QEUH-3335]Verify Integrity of Game Files[/url] for the game.
