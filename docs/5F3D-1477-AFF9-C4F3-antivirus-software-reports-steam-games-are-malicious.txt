[h1]Antivirus software reports Steam games are malicious[/h1]

My antivirus or firewall software reports my new Steam purchases contain a trojan or potentially dangerous program - what is happening?

We encourage protecting your PC from viruses, spyware and other forms of malicious software. However, it is not necessary to run antivirus and other security applications while you are engaged in playing a game on Steam.

Antivirus applications can interfere with Steam and can cause a range of problems from connection issues to games not launching correctly or crashing. Please set your antivirus to Game Mode or create exclusions for game files or processes before launching Steam if you are experiencing issues with your Steam games.

The Steam application or Steam game has been mistakenly identified as a virus or "trojan" by certain software as a result of the development of potentially-malicious programs which use the same filenames as valid Steam files (this is a very common practice amongst malicious software writers - many viruses already masquerade as valid operating system files).

We are continually working with the antivirus and firewall software vendors to ensure fewer false positives involving Steam appear in the future.

Some general issues that antivirus software can cause:

[list]

[*]Deleting or quarantining game installation files. This can prevent the game from launching, cause game crashes, or other major in-game issues.

[*]Preventing a game or Steam's process from launching, or stopping it shortly after it has launched.

[*]Preventing network communication from a game's or Steam's process. This can result in game or Steam crashes, or game or Steam features that rely on network communication to not work.

If you had to create exclusions for files that your antivirus software was deleting or corrupting, you can restore deleted or corrupted game installation files by following the instructions to [url=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2037-QEUH-3335]Verify Integrity of Game Files[/url] for the game.

We cannot provide any specific instructions for specific antivirus software solutions due to how many options there are and updates they receive.

If you need help with setting file or process exceptions in your antivirus software to allow game files to remain installed or processes to be allowed to run on your computer, please refer to your antivirus software's support articles and support team.
