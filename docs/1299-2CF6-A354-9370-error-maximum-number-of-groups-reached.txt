[h4]Why am I getting a max group limit error when trying to join a group?[/h4]
Once you have joined [b]1,000[/b] Steam groups, you will be unable to join any more groups. This limit does not include groups that you have created or official game groups.

[h4]How can I join more groups?[/h4]
To join more groups, please leave as many groups as needed to be below the limit. Navigate to [url=http://steamcommunity.com/my/groups/]your groups page[/url] and click "Leave Group" next to the respective group(s).

Remember, [url=http://steamcommunity.com/my/followedgames]Official Game Groups[/url] that you are following do not count towards the limit - there is no need to leave or unfollow them.

[h4]Is this limit dependent on my Steam Level?[/h4]
No, your Steam level only affects your friends limit.
