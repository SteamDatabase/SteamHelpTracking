[h2]TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS[/h2]

[list]

[*]Loading screen submissions require a 16:9 aspect ratio .png of preferrably 2048 x 1024 at 72dpi.  [/*]
[*]Our loading screen code is designed to use 16:9 as a base and achieve 16:10 and 4:3 aspect ratios by cropping the edges equally. [/*]
[*]It's helpful if the most important elements of your image lie within the 4:3 area in the center. [/*]

[h2]OTHER NOTES[/h2]

[list]

[*]For item set loading screens, it is preferable to avoid Dota logos and text. [/*]
[*]This image may also be used as a marketing image or as an armory icon. [/*]
[*]If this image is connected to an item set, please ensure that the image is an accurate representation of the items. [/*]
[*]If we request drastic changes to any items, we may either ask you to revise the screen to match the final items or we may not use the loading screen. [/*]
[*]If you are submitting a loading screen for a team, player, or caster, they need to be included in the revenue share. Be sure to read the [url=https://support.steampowered.com/kb/4569-PDXC-8590/dota-2-team-player-or-caster-branded-items]Team, Player or Caster Branded Item[/url] guidelines. [/*]
