[h1]Setting Game Launch Options[/h1]

How can I set game launch options?

Game launch options can be used to change game settings before running the game. Launch options allow the user to supersede internal settings of the game. This is an effective means to recover from incompatible video settings as well as troubleshooting a wide range of issues.

This topic covers setting game launch options from Steam's [b]Library[/b]. Launch options may also be set by creating a game shortcut and [url=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=5623-QOSV-5250]Setting Steam Launch Options[/url] for the shortcut.

[h4]Common Launch Options[/h4]

[section style=note]These launch options apply to GoldSrc and Source engine games only. They do not apply to most third party games.

Please refer to [url=https://store.steampowered.com/search/?category1=998&developer=Valve]this list of Valve titles[/url] for titles that support these launch options
[/section]

Many [url=http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Console_Command_List]Console Commands[/url] can function as a launch option by adding a "+" in front of the console command, but some cannot be used in this fashion. The most common launch options are listed below.

[list]

[*]-autoconfig - Restores video and performance settings to default for the current hardware detected. Ignores settings inside any .cfg files until this parameter is removed. [/*]
[*]-dev - Enables developer mode. Also disables the automatic loading of menu background maps and stops the quit dialog from appearing on exit. [/*]
[*]-condebug - Logs all console output into the console.log text file. [/*]
[*]-console - Starts the game with the developer console enabled. [/*]
[*]-toconsole - Starts the engine directly in the console, unless a map is specified with +map. [/*]
[*]-dxlevel [level] - Forces a specific DirectX version when launching the game. This is useful if your graphics hardware is older, and gets significantly better performance in an earlier version of DirectX. Below are the most common modes used:

[list]

[*]-dxlevel 80 [/*]
[*]-dxlevel 81 [/*]
[*]-dxlevel 90 [/*]
[*]-dxlevel 95 [/*]
[*]-dxlevel 98

[section style=warning]

[h3]Warning:[/h3]
Our games no longer support DirectX 7 as a launch option. Using this can cause crashes. If you are using -dxlevel 70 make sure to remove it from your launch options.
