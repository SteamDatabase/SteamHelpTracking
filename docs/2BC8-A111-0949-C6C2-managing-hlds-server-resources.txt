[h1]Managing HLDS Server Resources[/h1]

How can I control how my HLDS server resources are managed?

In all below descriptions, 1 = enabled, 0 = disabled

[h4]Client side:[/h4]

[list]

[*][i]cl_allowdownload 1/0[/i]
Allow/Prevent any download from the server to the client. [/*]
[*][i]cl_allowupload 1/0[/i]
Allow/Prevent any content (including sprays) from being sent from the client to the server. [/*]

[/list]

[h4]Server side:[/h4]

[list]

[*][i]sv_allowupload 1/0[/i]
Allows/Prevents clients sending custom sprays to the server.

NOTE: sv_allowupload 0 will cause the message:

"ignoring custom decal from xxxxxx" on the server console. [/*]
[*][i]sv_send_logos 1/0[/i]
Enables/Prevents the server from sending custom sprays to the clients. [/*]
[*][i]sv_send_logos 1[/i]
requires sv_allowdownload 1 to work. [/*]
[*][i]sv_allowdownload 1/0[/i]
Enables/Prevents the server from downloading any content to the client (maps, sprays and related). [/*]
[*][i]sv_send_resources 1/0[/i]
Enable/Disable all secure resources from being sent to the client. [/*]
[*][i]sv_filetransfercompression 1/0[/i]
Enables/Disables the server from compressing & sending compressed content to the client. [/*]
[*][i]sv_downloadurl <url>[/i]
Setting this CVAR will allow Clients to download Custom Content via HTTP instead of sourcing the content from the game server, much faster. [/*]
[*][i]hpk_maxsize 0/(variable number, set to 0.1 to minimize)[/i]
No limit/100k limit to the size of the custom.hpk file on the server that stores all the sprays from the client. [/*]
