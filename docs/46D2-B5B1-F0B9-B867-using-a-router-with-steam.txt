[h1]Using a Router with Steam[/h1]

How do I determine if my router is causing a Steam connection issue?  How do I configure my router to work with Steam?

[h4]Basic Router Troubleshooting[/h4]
It may seem obvious, but it's worth rebooting your modem, router, or modem/router combination device before trying anything else.

If your modem and router (or wireless access point) are separate devices, test with a direct connection to your modem:

[olist]

[*]Close the Steam client application. [/*]
[*]Bypass your router by plugging your machine directly into the modem. [/*]
[*]Test that your internet connection is working, then restart Steam and check connectivity. [/*]

[/olist]

If you are able to connect to Steam after bypassing your router, it indicates a router configuration or compatibility issue.

[h4]Router Configuration[/h4]
Certain router services can cause problems with Steam. If any of the following services are enabled on your router or access point, try disabling them:

[list]

[*]Stateful inspection [/*]
[*]Dynamic packet filtering [/*]
[*]QoS (Quality of Service) [/*]
[*]UPnP (Universal Plug 'n Play) [/*]

[/list]
