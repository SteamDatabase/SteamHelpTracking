[h1]Windows XP and Windows Vista Support[/h1]

As of January 1 2019, Steam officially stopped supporting the Windows XP and Windows Vista operating systems. The Steam Client will no longer run on those versions of Windows. In order to continue running Steam and any games or other products purchased through Steam, users will need to update to a more recent version of Windows.

The newest features in Steam rely on an embedded version of Google Chrome, which no longer functions on older versions of Windows. In addition, future versions of Steam will require Windows feature and security updates only present in Windows 7 and above.
