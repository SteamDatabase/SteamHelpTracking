[h3]Note:[/h3]
We have made some changes to how Steam Wallet Codes are redeemed on Steam, as part of our ongoing effort to reduce scams like the ones explained [url=https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/paying-scammers-gift-cards]HERE[/url]. These changes should not impact regular customers who enjoy using Steam wallet codes they purchase at retail in their local currency.

Each Steam User Account is associated with a specific currency, which you can see in the top right corner of your Steam Client.  Going forward, you may encounter an error if you try to activate a Steam Wallet Code issued in a different currency than the one of your Steam User Account.

If you have questions about your ability to redeem Steam Wallet Codes, please contact [url=https://help.steampowered.com]Steam Support[/url].  If you are concerned about the legitimacy of a Steam code you have purchased, you should ask your retailer.
