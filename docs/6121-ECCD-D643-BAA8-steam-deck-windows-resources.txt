Steam Deck is a PC, and other applications and OSes can be installed. If you're installing Windows, you will need a few additional drivers to have the best experience. Links to these, along with notes for installing Windows on Steam Deck can be found below.

We are providing these resources as is and are unfortunately unable to offer 'Windows on Deck' support. If you get stuck and need a way back to the default Steam Deck OS, please follow [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/1B71-EDF2-EB6D-2BB3]these recovery instructions[/url].

[h4]Dual-Boot with SteamOS not yet available[/h4]

[list]

[*]Installing Windows requires you to wipe your Steam Deck, and dual-boot with SteamOS is not currently available.

[*]While Steam Deck is fully capable of dual-boot, the SteamOS installer that provides a dual-boot wizard isn't ready yet. This will ship alongside SteamOS 3 once it's complete.

[h4]Notes for installing Windows[/h4]

[list]

[*]To get to the boot menu, power down. Then, while holding Volume Down, press the power button.

[*]Installation will be in portrait orientation (sideways) on the Steam Deck screen. You can switch this to landscape once Windows is installed.

[*]To enter your product key during installation, you'll need internet. Because there are no Wi-Fi drivers at this point, you'll need a USB-C hub with an Ethernet port for internet.

[*]Both Windows 10 and Windows 11 are supported. For Windows 11, make sure you have the latest OS update (in order to get the latest BIOS with fTPM support) before installing.
