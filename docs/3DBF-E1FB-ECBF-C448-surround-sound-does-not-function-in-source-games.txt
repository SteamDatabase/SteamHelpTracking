[h1]Surround Sound does not Function in Source Games[/h1]

Source games rely on the operating system to identify the audio device for them. If your surround setup is not properly configured in Windows or is configured through a proprietary control panel, it may not be properly recognized by Source games.

[list]

[*]Ensure that your audio device is setup appropriately in your Windows Control Panel.
[*]Launch the game and adjust your settings in the [b]Options > Audio[/b] menu.
[/list]

If the issue persists, close any proprietary audio control applications and repeat the process.

You can also use one of the following launch options to test the issue:

[code]+snd_legacy_surround 1[/code]
[code]+snd_digital_surround 1[/code]
