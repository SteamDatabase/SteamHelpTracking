[h1]How do I get my Server to be VAC Secure?[/h1]

Enabling VAC security requires a different process for the different types of dedicated servers.

The process for enabling VAC security is the same for [b]Steam Half-Life Dedicated Servers[/b] and [b]Steam Source Dedicated Servers[/b].

VAC Security is enabled by default for Standalone Dedicated Servers. To turn VAC security [b]OFF[/b] for your Standalone Dedicated server add [i]-insecure[/i] to your launch switches.
