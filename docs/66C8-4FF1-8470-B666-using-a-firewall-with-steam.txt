[h1]Using a Firewall with Steam[/h1]

How should I configure my firewall to work with Steam?

[section style=important]

[h3]Important:[/h3]
If you are installing Steam for the first time or if there has been a recent Steam update, a firewall may be preventing Steam from connecting to the Steam Network.

You may be asked to re-authorize Steam after a client update. Some Steam games may also prompt for firewall authorization after a game update.

[h4]Troubleshooting Steps[/h4]

[olist]

[*]Close the Steam client application. [/*]
[*]Open the configuration view for your firewall program, and remove any instances of the following executables from the permissions:

[list]

[*]steaminstall.exe [/*]

[exclude_realm=china]
[*]steam.exe [/*]

[/exclude_realm]

[exclude_realm=global]
[*]steamchina.exe [/*]

[/exclude_realm]

[*]hl.exe [/*]
[*]hl2.exe [/*]
[*]steamTmp.exe [/*]

[/list]
[/*]
[*]Start Steam. Your firewall should prompt you to set new permissions for steam.exe. If it does not, the security settings may be too strict - you will need to change these settings so you will be prompted to set permissions.

Give the Steam executables permission for all TCP and UDP ports when prompted. [/*]
[*]Restart your computer and start Steam. [/*]

[/olist]

[h4] [/h4]
If you are still having connectivity problems, you may try the following test:

[list]

[*]Exit the Steam client. [/*]
[*]Temporarily disable your firewall. [/*]
[*]Restart Steam and test connectivity. [/*]
[*]Re-enable your firewall. [/*]

[/list]

If Steam operates normally only when your firewall is disabled, please recheck your firewall configuration. You may wish to contact the provider of your firewall for configuration help. [b]We do not recommend leaving your firewall disabled.[/b]
