[h1]How To Request A Refund[/h1]

Valve will, upon request via [url=https://help.steampowered.com]help.steampowered.com[/url], issue a refund for any title that is requested within 14 days of purchase and has been played for less than 2 hours. Even if you fall outside of the refund rules we've described, you can submit a request and we'll take a look at it.

Additional information and troubleshooting instructions for existing refund requests can be found in our [url=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=4873-QOSK-5126]Common Refund Questions[/url] FAQ.
