[h1]Scam: I Have Been Reported and Will Be Banned[/h1]

[section style=warning][b]Any claim that you've been accidentally or falsely reported for fraud or any other infraction is a scam. Do not follow any instructions provided by anyone claiming to have accidentally reported your account. [/b]

If someone did report your account falsely and you're concerned about being banned, you can rest assured that Steam disregards false reports.

Valve employees will [i]never[/i] communicate with you about your account using any chat system including Steam Chat and Discord. The only way you can speak with a Steam Support agent about your account is through the [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/]Steam Support Help Site[/url]. There's no situation in which you'd need to reach out to a Valve or Steam employee directly to resolve an issue.

[h1]Preventing the Scam[/h1]

[h5]Protecting your account[/h5]

If you notice any of the indicators listed above, do not follow any instructions provided by the scammer and block any online chat, voice, or email accounts they've used to communicate with you.

[h5]Reporting any Steam accounts involved in the scam[/h5]

[url=https://help.steampowered.com/faqs/view/4D07-D139-587C-2080]Report[/url] any Steam accounts involved in the scam. If a friend's account is involved their account is likely stolen. Your report will help Steam identify and lock down the stolen account until its owner recovers it.

If the scammer spoke to you using any non-Steam accounts, you can use that application's own reporting tools to help them identify the scammer accounts and prevent their misuse.

[h1]Recovering your account[/h1]
If you've fallen for this scam, you can recover your Steam account at any time using the [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/]Steam Support Help Site[/url]. Click [url=https://help.steampowered.com/wizard/HelpWithLogin]Help, I can't sign in[/url] to start the recovery process.

[section style=note]Some scammers may state that you can't recover your account because they already changed all of its information. This is part of the scam, and is false. You should ignore any statements or advice the scammer offers.
