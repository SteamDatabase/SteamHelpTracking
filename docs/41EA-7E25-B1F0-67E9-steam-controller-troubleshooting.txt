[h4]Intended Trackpad Dead Zone Area[/h4]
To avoid unintentional inputs while switching between the right trackpad and the face buttons (A B X Y), the lower left edge of the right trackpad will sometimes deliberately ignore input. This is intended behavior and does not indicate a defect with your controller.

If another piece of your hardware has been lost or damaged, please contact Steam Support for replacement options.
