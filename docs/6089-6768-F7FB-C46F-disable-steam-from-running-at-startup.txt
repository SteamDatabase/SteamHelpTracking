[h1]Disable Steam from running at startup[/h1]

How do I stop Steam from running automatically when I start my computer?

With Steam open, click the [b]Steam [/b]menu, and choose [b]Settings[/b].

Click on the Interface tab, and uncheck the box that says:

"[b]Run Steam when my computer starts[/b]."
