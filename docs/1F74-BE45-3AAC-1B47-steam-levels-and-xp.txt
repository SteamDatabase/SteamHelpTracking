[*]The maximum amount of friends is initially capped at 250 for accounts. For every Level gained, you will be able to have 5 more friend slots. This can expand to a maximum of 2000 total possible friends.

[*]For every 10 Levels gained, you will receive 1 Showcase slot. These can be used to display a unique Showcase on the Profile (achievements, videos, screenshots, etc.). This can expand to a maximum of 20 at this time but more may be added in the future. Note: if you have bought an extra Showcase on the Points Shop, that adds an extra Showcase slot on top of the maximum.
