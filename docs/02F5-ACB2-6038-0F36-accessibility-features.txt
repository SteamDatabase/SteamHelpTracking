[h1]Accessibility Features[/h1]

Steam now allows developers to display some of the accessibility features their games support to help players search for and find games based on selected criteria that may meet their needs. These tags are not intended to be an exhaustive list of every accessibility feature a game might support.

To find games with these features, visit the search page and select the accessibility features you're looking for:
